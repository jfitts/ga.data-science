"US1000000109","Flavor Wine Retail"," 	 Flavor Wine Retail is new retail concept in San Francisco's Jackson Square that targets the largest segment of the wine market: people who enjoy wine but are not experts or aficionados.  They find today's retail environment confusing, the labels, regions, varietals, language, and scores rarely helpful in identifying the wines they will like.  Flavor offers a new schematic that makes it easy for people to find the wines taste good to them, and records those preferences so we know what our customers want.  We use this to look for and stock higher margin offerings, and target our marketing so we pitch special deals to the people we know will want them.   	 Flavor will start as a wine shop with a wine lounge and web storefront.  The Lounge serves to continually prospect new customers from the entire city where they become regular customers, buying primarily through our targeted special offers to them and our web storefront.

Current propulsion technologies do not provide sufficient performance for many applications; both scientific and reconnaissance.  Fusion based propulsion concepts offer much higher performance, however, these concepts require large energy/mass driver mechanisms that are not feasible on the scale of small satellites.

The new company is focused entirely upon IT solutions supporting the biomass industry. The single biggest challenge today is for geographically dispersed bio-refineries to obtain the required amount and quality of biomass feedstock to operate the facility efficiently. Biomass feedstock is any biological material that meets specification for a technology to convert it into energy. Examples of biomass feedstocks include crop residues such as corn stover, sugarcane bagasse, purpose-grown grass crops, and woody materials such as chips and sawdust. Biomass feedstocks are converted into energy by directly burning to produce steam for heat and power and well as refining into liquid fuels/products. Biomass is not yet a commodity because it is highly variable, dispersed, and unquantified at a scale that translates to financial market protocols. ","AngelList","Technology","Tech.

In more than half of the states with sales tax, TaxCloud can even automatically report and remit sales tax proceeds, and will even respond to any subsequent audit inquiries - all at no cost to the retailers because we are paid by the states to make sales tax compliance as easy as possible.

That led us to write our own software for release management.

As a result, small businesses are still stuck in the stone ages and still connect the old fashioned way by attending the local networking event. Thousands of events take place every day and millions are spent every day to attend them.

MonBaby takes a proactive approach to monitoring. Parents don't have to watch their baby 24 hours a day as they used to do with traditional baby monitors. With the MonBaby smart button and Monbaby app (iPhone or Android), parents can receive alerts to their smartphone if no breathing movements are detected, if the baby rolls over to her stomach, if she leaves a proximity area or falls. Measurements are done in real-time, five times per second and transmitted from the button to the smartphone app.

Chiron Health changes this dynamic by providing a secure technology platform that leverages the existing computers, tablets, and mobile devices that physicians and patients use every day, and by providing a high-touch service component that handles all of the regulatory and administrative complexities of practicing telemedicine—including full reimbursement from private payers.","AngelList","Technology","IT Services","Healthcare Information Services","Austin","TX","US","http://www.chironhealth.com","https://angel.co/chiron-health","Convertible Debt","Closed","2013-12-21 08:01:20","2013-12-21 08:01:20","FALSE","500000.0","0.00","","","","","http://www.linkedin.com/company/3566359?trk=prof-exp-company-name","https://www.facebook.com/chironhealth","https://twitter.com/chironhealth","","","","","","20%","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most printers are built for hobbyists and electronics enthusiasts tinkering in a garage. We are creating printers that help you get printing.   	Our hardware has a few unique features to it.  The main distinction is our Z-axis design. Most printers use a long screw to move the build table up and down. Low quality screws can lead to poor quality prints, though, so we've replaced the Z screw with a belt system that allows for rapid movement and smooth prints.   	Our software also helps 3D printer users in several aspects. Not only does it include filament inventory management, but also provides a parts library and Thingiverse integration. Our software is also the only software with ""print recovery,"" allowing you to ""rewind"" a failed print to attempt to recover it.   	And finally, we're making it affordable.

The KetchUp mobile app works by collecting data from multiple sources such as your email, social networks, music and location. Our technology uses that data and builds a personalized radio station that is informative and entertaining. For example, during your morning commute, the app tells you about your first meeting of the day. So, as you drive to work in the morning, it almost feels like Charlie Rose is talking to you about your next meeting, LinkedIn connection updates etc.

In early 2008, Jobe Consulting Group, LLC launched into a new business arena and started its Property Development Consulting business area.  This business area provides project management, construction management, marketing, preliminary design and planning, and construction engineering consulting services to its commercial clients.   	 Our business model is predicated on taking advantage of the available low acreage lots that are close to and inside the District of Columbia border that are typically ignored by most real estate developers.  By consolidating these lots and developing what we call energy positive single family homes we will create a niche market  and deliver exceptional value and product quality to the marketplace.  The lots range in size from a low of 0.11 acres to a high of1.5 acres and are all zoned R-60.  The market differentiator for these new construction homes will be the integration of eco-friendly and energy efficient components into the design and build of each home. These components will include, but not be limited to:  Photovoltaic (solar) energy systems and/or wind energy systems; Natural Gas power cell generator energy systems; Geo-thermal heating/cooling systems; Sustainably-sourced wood flooring (primarily use bamboo).  It is our intent to create a new company once we have procured funding and are offering 40% equity ownership in that new entity.

"US30000013FB","Medigram"," 	    In 2014, the medical profession remains tethered to an antiquated paging system. Doctors still carry around those garage door opener-sized pagers the rest of us did our best to recycle in the mid-1990s. Like you still see on TV and movies, they receive shorthand pages from the hospital, which alerts the user to find a phone to call in and receive the information they need. This leads to miscommunications and clinicians wasting valuable time awaiting responses. A study by CISCO estimates that over $10 billion in value has been lost due to inefficiencies in medical communication.   	     There are two reasons for this: 1) the security and privacy standards within HIPAA regulations and 2) institutional inertia endemic to large hospitals when it comes to implementing a system-wide technology solution.   	     We believe Medigram is the company poised to solve this two-pronged problem for many healthcare providers and the beneficiary of significant value for themselves (and investors) along the way.   	 Opportunity   	     In the medical field, physicians and medical staff continue to use outdated methods of communication such as pagers and fax machines. In an industry where every second counts, using antiquated methods of communication can mean dramatic differences in patient care.  Clinicians often resort to texting, which violates HIPAA regulations as SMS messages are not encrypted or secure. These penalties can cost over $10,000 per text and put an entire hospital at risk. Medigram solves these problems by providing one of the first convenient and secure ways for medical teams to communicate, within the guidelines of HIPAA.   	 Business Model   	     In 3-5 years, all health care communication will be done on tablets and smartphones. Medigram’s objective is to scale quickly and capture the majority of this emerging market.  With Medigram’s Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model, the service can quickly scale to hospitals and clinics around the country. The company is targeting a price point of $150-$200 annually per user for use of its software.

Quantum has launched a product for accounting in higher education, is partnered with textbook publisher John Wiley & Sons, Inc. and has delivered over 1.5 million online sessions to 350 schools nationwide. Quantum is emerging from the laboratory and is ready to scale with one goal: acquisition. Currently the educational industry  has yet to figure out how to deliver content  which is meaningful, personalized, efficient and cost-effective. Most publishers and online learning institutions (for-profit and non-profit) are spending millions to create digital versions of the same old textbooks and flashcards, jamming videos and dozens of other ineffective materials into an online homework system. Quantum, which is rated as the “most helpful resource” by students, is the only company capable of rendering this abundance of available content into intelligent learning and assessment technologies for students and faculty that also seamlessly integrate with publisher/online ebooks, digital media and legacy learning management and homework systems. Quantum's technologies have been prototyped and field tested in other disciplines such as chemistry, developmental mathematics and braille which demonstrates scalability to a wide range of content areas.","EquityNet","Technology","Computer Software","Internet Software & Services","Murrysville","PA","US","http://www.quantumhelps.com","http://www.equitynet.com/c/quantum-simulations-inc","Equity","Closed","2014-01-31 15:52:04","2014-01-31 15:52:04","TRUE","5000000.0","0.00","","","","","http://www.linkedin.com/company/quantum-simulations-inc./products","https://www.facebook.com/QuantumTutors","https://twitter.com/quantumhelps","https://plus.google.com/u/0/106810628121113420523/posts#106810628121113420523/posts","https://www.youtube.com/user/QuantumTutors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"US1000001466","Drill Cycle"," 	The increasing drilling rig activity on US land has resulted in an increased demand for economic and managed liability drilling waste solutions. In Texas, environmental regulations allow O&amp;G operators to dispose of drilling cuttings waste on site, however, few operators do so due to apprehension of long term disposal liability. The disposal liability stems from drill cuttings exiting the wellbore saturated in diesel based drilling fluid. This has resulted in years of transporting drilling cuttings waste to an offsite disposal site. Drill Cycle will capitalize on the new market of onsite disposal for its South Texas clients by reducing their capital spent on disposal, reducing short term liability of transporting waste, and reducing long term liability of disposing of high oil content drill cuttings on third party managed landfills.   	The O&amp;G play that Drill Cycle will target initially will be South Texas Eagle Ford Shale. Drill Cycle services will be twofold; (1) dispose of drill cuttings on site and (2) recover diesel from the drilling waste. To do so, Drill Cycle will acquire equipment and material required to process drill cuttings from an initial 10-15% by weight oil on cuttings to a final product of less than 1% by weight.  The equipment utilized will be mobile and will process drill cuttings waste on the drilling pad site. The mobile units will process the drill cuttings waste into two separate streams of solids and liquids. The solids will be disposed of onsite and buried thereafter.  Diesel reclaimed from the separation process will be sold back to the customer for reuse.   	Drill Cycle’s services will be a first in South Texas oilfield. Drill Cycle services will reduce the $/bbl their clients spend on disposal by 30 – 50%, reduce their client’s short and long term disposal liability, and reduce equipment required to recover costly drilling fluid while drilling.

The company will continue on the same mission, but will re-register and establish itself as a Woman Majority-Owned business. Cynthia Daily is going to lead the company as its’ Executive Director. Mrs. Daily has always been the driving force behind the operations, and is of Native American decent. She has the perceptive insight of following and honoring how the Native American addresses mining. Establishing a successful and safe mining operation that will provide a strong base for jobs, while protecting mother-earth is her primary objective.

The company has identified properties that contain minerals of direct importance to the National and Economic Security of this Country. In recent years, the United States has found itself increasingly dependent on the import of many strategically important metals and minerals from countries such as China, despite having a wealth of these commodities within our own borders. After an initial extended period of research, the company determined the most viable location to begin its’ first phase of the project, and specifically evaluated mineral deposits with excellent accessibility for year-around production.

The company has performed its’ first processing of heavy sand by utilizing a Keene Magnetic Separator, and was able to process 1000 lbs. of raw feed that was separated by a gravity concentration recovery. The concentrate was further analyzed, crushed and leached, and then by fire assay produced 1.15 grams of Gold and 1.95 grams of Silver. The company was also successful in sending 320 lbs. of raw feed to MTI for their metallurgical work-up and testing to produce a heavy metal concentrate and preform a bench scale test to produce typical Magnetite, Titanium, and Zircon products. The company’s next step is to establish its’ mill site for 10 ton @ hour Demo Plant to be placed into operation.","EquityNet","Materials","Basic Resources","Metals & Minerals","Kennewick","WA","US","http://www.metalsfortomorrow.com ","http://www.equitynet.com/c/remediation-of-nevada-llc","Equity","Closed","2014-02-05 21:01:58","2014-02-05 21:01:58","FALSE","650000.0","400000.00","","","","","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/wayne-daily/36/762/b31","","","","https://www.youtube.com/embed/-hAvV6VSor0?rel=0&autoplay=1&wmode=opaque","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Each year tens of millions of tons are used for packaging, storing, and serving. Seventy-six (76) percent of all EPS produced ends up in a landfill. Despite its usefulness, EPS suffers from limited options for recycling.  The difficulty in recycling lies mainly in problems with transport of this valuable material. The very characteristic of light weight to volume ratio that makes EPS so useful, is its' main drawback for transport to a recycling station. StyroPower solves this problem by densifying the EPS material into a plastic block with a density of greater than 30lbs per cubic foot.

PureShield is seeking additional partners to assure PureShield attains a leadership position in the antimicrobial products industry.

PureShield is the owner of four EPA registrations for a highly unique antimicrobial technology.  Product Sales produce GM % of 70%.   The technology utilized is completely dissimilar to that found in other conventional antimicrobial products now available for use in the market place.  
Distinctively Unique Technology
The technology employed by PureShield products is entirely unique to all other antimicrobial products and disinfectants. PureShield products mode of action is to remain “bound” to the applied surface. They work as a surface protectant, inhibiting microbial growth on the applied surface without the use of poisons or heavy metals. The concept is analogous to how ScotchGard® protects fabrics from dirt and moisture or Clear Coat protects today’s car paint from environmental damage. Our surface protectants shield surfaces from microbial activity. Due to the products being bound surface protectants, the benefits are never depleted, thereby providing long-term residual protection. All other antimicrobial/disinfectant products currently available employ an “unbound” leaching technology, meaning that they are not bound to the applied surface and therefore the benefits of the product diminish over time. In addition, the EPA allows it to be applied to almost any porous and non-porous substrates.

Using a crowdsourced, interactive feature (developed exclusively for SociaLive by the Founder), as well as a unique ranking methodology for all user content, SociaLive offers users a very new social networking experience that is fundamentally different than reddit's voting algorithms  and the overpopulated useless-posts posted Facebook. In fact, both the 'Business Insider' and research from the University of Colorado Denver Business School have found that Facebook is declining in popularity with critical demographics, such as high school students and undergraduate college students, due to a variety of features unique to Facebook. Again, SociaLive was designed to exploit these vulnerabilities to the utmost.

"US10000017A4","Grand Prix Holdings USA","GP Holdings is a group formed to raise investment capital for design, development and manufacturing of emerging & innovative designs in the 2-wheeled vehicle industry. Many small- to medium-sized motorcycle manufacturers have new products designed for global distribution but lack the financial resources to bring their products to market. These companies require capital to turn their ideas into tangible products; most employ high-level designers and engineers to create these products. 

In return for investment capital, GP Holdings  and its investors gain a large percentage of company equity and rights to distribute products in select markets, including the USA, the single largest motorcycle market in the world.

One such company currently seeking capital  is EBR, Inc in Wisconsin. This company was established in 1983  by a former engineer of Harley-Davidson motorcycles, and has a history of building innovative sport motorcycles for markets around the world; over 140,000 bikes have been produced with revenue of $1.5Billion to date. A network of some 150 dealers distributes their products internationally. This company, including product inventory and machinery, is currently available for sale.

Another company is PEP Moto Italia, owner of 4 motorcycle brands and an engineering consulting group. They have been producing high-performance motorcycles since 1958, and have International Grand Prix motorcycle racing experience. PEP Moto has secured exclusive rights to use of new clean-burn engine technology  in 2-wheeled vehicles worldwide. The parent company is seeking funding for production of new models, using in-house design, assembly and marketing services for these products. PEP Moto has plans to establish a network of 'boutique' stores in major global markets to distribute their products, similar to the model Tesla Motors uses.

It is in the areas of product design & manufacturing, and engineering consulting, that GP Holdings seeks capital to pursue.

"US10000017AC","IntroToMe.com"," 	Today, we have many online resources at our disposal to get noticed.  The challenge is in getting introduced--getting an impression across to your audience that cannot show through on social media, email signature, job resume, business card, or website profile page.  Those formats are static displays which do little to differentiate you or your business from billions of others who use them.  A technology exists which perfectly bridges these gaps: video.  However, the vast majority of individuals and SMBs do not possess the time, money, or expertise to produce quality video content themselves.  With those barriers removed, what could you accomplish with a commercial…for you?  The market is in need of an appropriate solution.  The technology is video; the solution is IntroToMe.com.   With a public launch targeted for May 2014, IntroToMe will enable people with no video production experience to fully produce, maintain, and easily distribute a quality, 1-3 minute video introduction of themselves or their organization to their target audience. Unlike online video hosting sites such as YouTube, Viddy, Vines, etc., IntroToMe is a tool rather than a toy.  For a small monthly subscription fee, we provide planning tools, templates with pre-written content, coaching on shooting video segments, automated editing, hosting and publishing that can be incorporated into all online and traditional media.   This all-in-one platform approach defines IntroToMe as a unique, early-to-market product that brings the proactive power and reach of video marketing to people and businesses without the long, steep learning curve or expense of production.   In addition to our three initial target markets of Service Providers, Job Seekers, and Individuals/Organizations, we are designing a Corporate module which will dramatically reduce the time and expense of the hiring process, and benefit everyone from Applicant to HR Manager to Hiring Manager.

The Geo Lid completely departs from prevalent “Sippy Cup” lid designs and offers a completely new experience. 

Hot beverages have evolved in complexity of taste, smell, and value but food packaging products have failed to keep up.

Carmichael &amp; Co. combines quality leather, trims and fabric  with artisanal craftsmanship to provide the perfect bicycle bags that meet quality, style and functionality demands. Additionally, by selling direct to consumers online, we can offer prices that are 50% less than other comparable brands.   	Our line of panniers and handlebar bags has already become a big hit with consumers through our previous crowd funding campaign, which raised over $1,500 in pre-orders in less than 24 hours. We feel that with a stronger web presence and a wider variety of products, we could sustain this same eagerness and grow our customer base quicker.   	After initial consumer success, we’re prepared to advertise, enhance our ecommerce store, increase our product line and expand our manufacturing and distribution capabilities to bring  Carmichael &amp; Co. to consumers across the world.

"US1000001949","MyCordBank.com"," 	  We are in the business of storing cord blood and tissue for newborns.  The industry is growing 12% per year worldwide and in the U.S.  To date the offering has been rather expensive with the heavily branded companies, and the low price leader has done very well and currently stores at our Lab.  We are now going retail and our pricing and offering are incomparable.  Firstly, we are donating up to $2000.00 in a T ROW PRICE Education fund for our clients who opt to pay for their storage all in advance for 18 years.  This education fund will mature to be worth more then their initial $4000.00 (-$2000) investment in their cord blood and tissue storage.  Plans start as low as 895.00 and $99.00 to $149.00 annually.  We are looking for investors who would like to securitize their investment by each contract stored.  This is a close to a no risk investment as I have seen as their are many units and there is only a 1 per thousand default rate on annual storage.  These priceless stem cells cannot be saved again.  Although each contract is worth a minimum of $1800.00 over 18 years the cost to store each year is $15.00.  This is why multiple units can be put up as security and as we grow if the investor chooses to convert for an exit, all the better.

(MIFTI) is the only company in the world that can solve the current crisis of worldwide shortages in nuclear medicine through a low capital cost machine compared to the existing nuclear reactors. MIFTI scientists has done computational modeling, computer simulations, and laboratory experiments, for over the last twenty years.  Only recently have MIFTI’s scientists been able to overcome the instability problems of Z-pinch.  This problem was solved, because sophisticated software was made available to the MIFTI scientists at the University of California, Irvine by the U.S. Air Force.  Years of experimentation and understanding the science have led MIFTI’s scientists to conclude that the staged Z-pinch fusion approach will change the landscape of electricity production globally by providing a net energy gain from ten to fifty times the energy used to create the process.
MIFTI’s technology will have positive worldwide consequences, not only for energy, but will solve the current crisis of worldwide shortages in nuclear medicine, as staged Z-pinch is very flexible and can be applied to a number of earth’s dilemmas.  MIFTI’s goal is simply to provide the people of earth with energy and medicines, at a reasonable and fair price, with no carbon dioxide emissions.  MIFTI technology is environmentally friendly – and forever.

Storelli has the rare opportunity to a) create a completely new category in the sports market, and b) own this category in stores and minds of consumers. To date, despite limited resources and no marketing, Storelli has  attracted thousands of adopters at the youth / amateur levels in Europe and the US, in addition to serving world-class professional players (see pics). With an injection of capital and the resources required for marketing and R&amp;D, Storelli is positioned to become the newest and next big brand in soccer.   	 WHY PROTECTION IN SOCCER: Soccer is the most played sport in the world- every year more than 80mm active players are at risk from suffering preventable injuries in US and Western Europe alone. The great majority of these players are youth, with  parents sitting on the sidelines anxiously hoping their child doesn't get hurt. At the same time, coaches and the players themselves hate injuries and would love to avoid them, and even retailers are hungry for new categories of products to increase the spend per customer. In sum, EVERY stakeholder in the market is highly motivated to stop soccer injuries and thus want to see Storelli succeed.   	 COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE: Despite the market demand for a solution to injuries, no brand focuses on this need: the major diversified sports brands (e.g., Adidas, Nike) do not focus on protection in soccer. The niche sports medicine players (e.g., McDavid, Shock Doctor) do not focus on soccer. Storelli is the first and only brand to make a market in soccer protection, explaining the speed of its uptake to date and future potential.

"US1000001B4D","FEMA Guides Inc.","I have a small business selling educational guides for the past year in NYC
I am on this website seeking $12,000.00 to expand my business online. 


In 2013, My business saw mainly cash transactions. I sold the guides online via craigslist to people within NYC. I would meet them in a public place, and then we would have an exchange. This worked fine, as it grossed about $9,600 in sales. 

I knew I could expand outside of NYC by bringing my guides to the online marketplace. After doing alot of research, I realized that building my own website would allow me the largest market, however to build and host a website was a costly endeavor; I decided to settle on Scribd.com.


I wish to elaborate more, however I am only permitted 2000 characters in this box. You can view my business plan using the external link provided( I am currently working with SBA to refine my business plan so it may not be listed until the end of May.)

"US1000001B5E","Carolina Mountain Harvest"," 	The proposed business of Super Intensive Stacked Raceway Shrimp Farming is a new technology developed at Texas A&amp;M University by Dr. Addison Lawrence. We have secured an agreement with Royal Caridea L.L.C. to build a production facility in Western North Carolina. Our objective is to produce one million pounds of fresh organic shrimp and market it locally, with the intent to expand production as we move forward. Cost of building and operation until revenue can be realized will be in excess of 9.5 million dollars. We will be seeking investors and looking into Small Business Administration USDA loans for funding. Payback for this project is estimated to be 3-4 years with an average selling price per pound around $7.50 per pound.       Market competition is imported foreign head-off frozen shrimp. The US imports 5.5 billion dollars of shrimp annually from south East Asia, India and South America. Food safety is a major concern with foreign product. The ecological impact in producing countries has caused a decline in production in many of those countries. A devastating pathogen called Early Mortality Syndrome (EMS) has ravaged many production facilities completely wiping out shrimp production. Cost of shrimp has been escalating over the last few years and no relief is in sight. US pond farming has been on the rise, but is limited because of the low production rates and limited seasonal harvest. The production facility we propose is able to produce one million pounds of shrimp per year in staggered harvest in a climate controlled environment with automated feeding system, post-larvae nursery tanks, re-circulating filtration system and computer monitoring of critical metrics. The 20 stacked raceways will be constructed and consist of 7 rectangular ponds of 6-8 feet wide by 56 feet long  that will produce 428,000kg of shrimp annually.

"US1000001B99","STORELLI SPORTS, LLC"," 	 Storelli is the first and only brand focused exclusively on designing and manufacturing innovative protective gear for soccer. Storelli has the rare opportunity to a) create a completely new category in the sports market, and b) own this category in stores and minds of consumers. To date, despite limited resources and no marketing, Storelli has  attracted thousands of adopters at the youth / amateur levels in Europe and the US, in addition to serving world-class professional players (see pics). With an injection of capital and the resources required for marketing and R&amp;D, Storelli is positioned to become the newest and next big brand in soccer.   	 WHY PROTECTION IN SOCCER: Soccer is the most played sport in the world- every year more than 80mm active players are at risk from suffering preventable injuries in US and Western Europe alone. The great majority of these players are youth, with  parents sitting on the sidelines anxiously hoping their child doesn't get hurt. At the same time, coaches and the players themselves hate injuries and would love to avoid them, and even retailers are hungry for new categories of products to increase the spend per customer. In sum, EVERY stakeholder in the market is highly motivated to stop soccer injuries and thus want to see Storelli succeed.   	 COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE: Despite the market demand for a solution to injuries, no brand focuses on this need: the major diversified sports brands (e.g., Adidas, Nike) do not focus on protection in soccer. The niche sports medicine players (e.g., McDavid, Shock Doctor) do not focus on soccer. Storelli is the first and only brand to make a market in soccer protection, explaining the speed of its uptake to date and future potential.

Because New York State does not currently permit the medicinal use of marijuana, our loved ones were forced to choose between breaking the law and relief from painful symptoms associated with their illnesses.

So once New York State began the process of legalizing medical cannabis, we became excited to be a part of a revolution that will help so many in need.

The major hurdle LED lighting has needed to clear before it could begin its market takeover in earnest has always been cost. While blue chip companies such as GE and Philips have made the investment to make household LED bulbs affordable, there has been no such commitment made to the commercial sector. By operating on low overhead and cutting out all middlemen between the manufacturer and consumer, Ameriss has made affordable commercial LED solutions a reality. In addition to supplying high quality, low cost LED lamps and fixtures, Ameriss has developed a suite of tools making lighting audits and quotes easier than ever before for our partners, thereby ensuring rapid expansion and market penetration through high installer adoption rates.  In the last month alone, Ameriss has closed sales in excess of $250,000 dollars, with an average profit margin of over 40%. Currently Ameriss is restricted to project financing, allowing inventory to be ordered only as deals are closed. While competing on price alone has proven to be a successful model, Ameriss is also positioning itself to address the second most pressing need in the industry, availability. With the proper funding, Ameriss will be able to stock a full line of inventory in its warehouse and distribution center in Kansas City.

"US1000001C31","ViRTUAL INTERACTiVE, Inc.","Our goal: Is to build Syracuse's first major independent movie studio. Central New York is a crossroads for talent from New York City to Toronto, from Boston to Buffalo, with additional talent coming from Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, PA. This allows for a greater pool of theatrical and professional talent, much like any major production center such as New York City or Los Angeles, at a fraction of their production costs. It should also be noted, that as of 2013, New York state has extended the film production Tax Credit and increased it to 40% for  the production and post-production of feature length movies. NY also offers ""10 year Tax-Free zones"" of which ViRTUAL INTERACTiVE, Inc. qualifies.

Our Mission: In addition to national talent we support local and regional performance talent, including writers and accomplished independent film makers. Our a belief is that a smaller group of passionate, creative and talented individuals can bring powerful imagery and great stories to the big screen as well as the small screen. As an independent studio, ViRTUAL INTERACTiVE, Inc. carries a full compliment of studio equipment from complete crane systems to small portable jibs, doorway dollies, stabilizers, Arial Video Systems and motorized pan/tilt systems. We have all the tools needed to help get the right shot and tell a great story. We also carry a full array of lights and the necessary in-studio and field audio equipment to capture high quality sound. In post production ViRTUAL INTERACTiVE, Inc. is proud to own fully licensed, fully supported software and employs several editing bays running both Mac and Microsoft Windows. We also utilize all popular NLE platforms, including an array of essential video plug-ins.

Oklahoma City is a low risk, high growth market due to investment in oil and gas explorations and out sport teams which have been bringing in new, high paying jobs which has helped our housing market grow during the recession in 2008.

Our homes include solid wood doors, tornado shelters, premium stainless steel appliances, 3cm granite or quartz countertops, all wood cabinetry, energy efficient shielding and insulation, home automation controls for alarm system, lights, and heating and air, as well as elegant walk in showers and plush carpet- all which cost extra to the customer by other builders. We have gained  a strong customer base by offering the features they seek in a home at the right price without a premium up charge for each feature.   In addition, we have tractors, trailers, and diesel trucks to take on heavy loads and deliveries without the added cost of renting. We also have an experienced payroll and accounting staff on hand to manage the funds and costs.

Our primary function historically has been to provide consulting services in the areas of PCB design, assembly, MEMs packaging as well as advanced (high density/high speed) semiconductor packaging with an emphasis on signal integrity, reliability, thermal performance and manufacturability.   	Recent developments in the areas of PCB manufacturing and signal integrity have led us to our current licensing opportunity. We have patent/s pending for a unique technology that enables very precise control of a drilling machine for back-drilling of PCBs while simultaneously providing in process parametric (signal integrity) data.   	In simpler terms, we have invented/designed a means for the drill bit to determine (within microns) the distance from the end of the drill bit to the underlying substrate by using a specific type of electronic sensory  signal (very high frequency) that we send down the drill bit. In addition, for one specific application (PCB via drilling) we can make signal measurements to provide electrical response data about the via itself.   	While via drilling in PCBs is a very specialized field with a narrow market it opens doors to other applications/markets  involving precision machining and drilling as well as precision sensory surgical robotic control and/or feedback. There are also likely to be unforeseen markets driven by the current technology development.   	DfR is currently in the process of changing it's business model from a consulting company to a development and licensing company. We are open to discuss other business arrangements including the formation of a new entity or partnering with an existing business for this purpose.

"US1000001C83","CompBlue, LLC"," 	  CompBlue has been created to provide workers compensation insurance to blue collar companies. Funds from investors will be used to bolster required reserves and serve as ""collateral"" for the issuance of additional insurance policies. Insurance is a cash-intensive business by nature and as such, there are no plans for the company to have the need to tap into funds that have been invested. CompBlue will ""rent-a captive"" from an existing highly rated insurance carrier which will provide the coverage and strength necessary to get the product to market - under the name of CompBlue. CompBlue essentially purchases the insurance at wholesale and sells it to the public at retail. CompBlue collects the premiums from its customers, pays the wholesale cost to the carrier, and passes the net revenues from the margin on to its investors. Reserves/Collateral enables CompBlue to write $4.06 in retail policies for every $1.00 in reserves. From the $4.06, $3.00 goes to pay buy the wholesale policy and $1.06 is retained by the LLC for operations and distribution to investors. Within the framework of the wholesale policy, premiums paid for the coverage (wholesale cost of goods) are used to provide (1) income to the carrier, purchase administrative, infrastructure, and claims processing (approx. 25% of premium); plus re-insurance as required by law (approx. 10% of premium); (2) pay any losses from injuries to covered workers (19%-55%); with the remaining funds (10%-46% of premium) (3) being retained by the ""rent-a-captive"" as additional reserves/collateral for future policies (Retained Captive Earnings). Each policy issued is collateralized once at inception, with the same collateral in force each year the policy is renewed. For example: $25k collateralizes a $100k policy in year one. That same $25k continues to collateralize it year by year. In 10 years that $25k has collateralized $1mm in premium. The high investor returns come from the power of renewing policies.

"US1000001CF6","Green Energy Corp","Green Energy Corp. is a leader in software and services enabling the development and deployment of microgrids.   A microgrid combines multiple Clean Technology and Renewable Energy generation resources into a single power resource where electricity is produced and delivered directly onsite and can be configurable as a stand-alone system that can be inter-connected to a larger grid, or operate ""islanded"" when the utility grid is not available.  Microgrids are able to be connected to the utility grid to purchase power from the grid or sell power back to the grid as conditions dictate.  Microgrids encompass multiple types of energy generation resources, storage systems, and efficiency programs, allowing for optimal utilization of renewable energy resources and facilitating advanced energy management, demand response, and load reduction solutions, equating to often cheaper, more reliable, scalable and future-proof energy systems.

Green Energy Corp's subscription-based software platform, The GreenBus™, is the backbone for the renewable energy sector to scale and rapidly deploy microgrids and complete Ecosystems, while the GEC's Utility-specific Middleware allows for developers to connect microgrids to utilities. The “Maas” (Microgrids as a Service) package provides a suite of end-to-end solutions for engineering, financing, construction, operations and maintenance, making Green Energy Corp. a single-source microgrid solution. 

We are the leaders in the design of microgrids, and have developed software specific to the operation and optimization of microgrids, which is unique to the market, and we hold the only system-wide patent for microgrids in the U.S. 

Green Energy Corp. continues to gain rapid expansion and deployment of its GreenBus™ software platform and MaaS, and a recent Navigant Consulting article listed Green Energy Corp. as a ""top game-changing data management company"" in renewable energy.

"US3000001D8A","Amylon LLC"," 	  Why We Started This Company    	  Amylon™ LLC’s mission is to finance, develop and commercialize APH-1104 for mild to moderate Alzheimer’s Disease and other CNS disorders [Patents Pending]. Amylon™ LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of Aphios® Corporation (www.aphios.com). Aphios® is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing enhanced therapeutics for chronic, debilitating diseases and improving quality of life. My mother-in-law was diagnosed with AD at an early age and passed away 10 years later with great suffering.   	 What Sets Us Apart    	  Current AD research is centered on Beta (?)-secretase and Gamma (?)-secretase to decrease Beta amyloid (A?) and the assembly of tau tangles, biochemical ‘signatures’ of AD which are the basis of cognitive decline. All the recent clinical trials with ?- and ?-secretase inhibitors have failed. Our strategy is to activate ?-secretase, which effectively eliminates the substrate for ?-amyloid generation and both prevents and reduces A? plaques in AD.   	 Our Keys to Success    	  My evolutionary research has led to the realization that in order to solve the problems of cancer and aging such as AD, we must look to nature, marine organisms and terrestrial plants that have learned how to control aging and cancerous mutation, often living for hundreds to thousands of years. Other keys to success are good science and engineering intuition, ability to challenge and simplify complex problems of science and biology, and problem solving with outside-the-box approaches.

"US1000001D98","LaunchAngels"," 	Launch Angels combines the expertise of our management team and investment committee to identify opportunities through our expansive networks and through equity crowdfunding portals to build a fund of approximately ten companies. Investors benefit from access to venture deals without the hassles of research, paperwork, and tracking, and our open investment process which allows for visibility into our deal pipeline and Investment Meetings.   	The value of a diversified portfolio is well understood. Many accredited individuals we’ve spoken to would like to allocate a portion of their portfolio to early-stage/venture investing. But to date, angel investing has been inefficient, clubby, and time consuming, so it’s underrepresented in the typical portfolio.   	Launch Angels is a new kind of venture capital firm that enables accredited investors to become equity holders in Launch Angels venture funds — which then fund pre-screened, private companies. We invest across multiple sectors and all stages of a company’s development, and seek to leverage our expertise in equity crowdfunding to support entrepreneurs while providing a unique investment opportunity for individual angels looking to diversify their portfolio. The result is that deserving companies get the capital they need, and investors get unprecedented access to the seed stage companies they want.   	Women have made great strides in business and proven they can build and run successful businesses. Yet women entrepreneurs are still impacted by unequal access to capital.  We at Launch Angels understand the gap in raising capital for early stage women-led businesses, and this fund was formed to allow our investors to directly address that issue.  The capital raised by this fund will begin to be invested shortly after the fund closes, and investors in the fund will own a portfolio of select women-led, women-backed and women-friendly investments in about 12-18 months after close.

Connecting the BRM providers with BRM recipients through a uniform and global internet platform, and maintaining of current and ever growing database of available BMR, can quickly become a game changer in biomedical research.","AngelList","Technology","IT Services","Technology Services - Other","Seattle","WA","US","http://researchstir.com/","https://angel.co/research-stir","Equity","Closed","2014-06-15 22:01:41","2014-06-15 22:01:41","TRUE","75000.0","0.00","","","2000","","http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http://researchstir.com/support-goal/&title=Support Our Goal&source=http://researchstir.com/url","http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://researchstir.com/support-goal/&t=Support Our Goal","http://www.twitter.com/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"US1000001DE2","Global Acquisition Partners, LLC","The Opportunity 

High interest rate lenders provide commercial borrowers with loans that fill a borrowing gap between traditional banks and private equity capital providers. These loans are typically 1 – 5 year terms with interest rates of 12% - 18% and $1M - $50M in size. When lenders achieve desired returns earlier than loan maturity, they have a compelling opportunity if they can sell these loans to re-invest their principal into new loans.

Overview of the Strategy 

Global Acquisition Partners Income Fund, LP selects and purchases individual performing commercial and industrial loans from high interest rate lenders. The Fund does not purchase loan pools. Our investment strategy is to hold loans for yield, thereby mitigating the risk or reliance on liquid credit markets. The Fund portfolio pays investors a quarterly income averaging a 12% annual yield. Our investment strategy is simple, effective and transparent. 
 
The loans we select: 1) are secured by the borrower’s commercial assets; 2) undergo strict underwriting criteria with the added benefit of hindsight - the borrower’s loan payment history; thereby, reducing the risk of write downs or loss of principal. 3) $1 - $10 million principal balance. 4) loans to smaller middle market companies with revenue of up to $75 million and from almost any industry from anywhere in the United States. We only purchase loans of socially responsible companies. 
 
What Sets Us Apart

A balanced approach to risk, steady attractive income without volatility from stocks or bonds.  

Our Key To Success

Risk management. The Fund spreads all invested capital equally across the portfolio, thereby, reducing capital at risk of 5% - 10% per loan. We diversify by purchasing loans from many different industries so your capital is never exposed to the risk of any single industry.

How many people lost their life’s savings, jobs and homes? In the financial crash of 2008-09, the average loss of equity was a devastating 34% for 401(k) accounts. Because most 401(k)s primarily hold traditional mutual funds, stocks and bonds, the financial crash eviscerated 401(k)s. American corporations and employees lost because they were not allowed to move their retirement funds into a safe haven.   	 What Sets Us Apart    	 THE SOLUTION . . . .

"US1000001E4C","CineMallTec LLC","CineMall is developing an innovative business concept - a cutting-edge SmartTV software platform & next-generation shopping experience. 

Established in March 2014, CineMallTec LLC has invested personal equity in the amount of $221,480. Today, the company seeks to raise an additional and final amount $100k USD, in debt or equity. Debt repayment terms are negotiable. For equity, we offer a 10% stake in the company. 

With a market value of $245 billion (in 2013) and a growth rate of approximately 8%, this is a game-changing, real-time shopping of products from within movie and TV scenes - simply pause the content, click items on the screen, add to basket, check-out. One has to see it to believe it!  

T-commerce has been a dream for more than a decade, yet this technology is only recently possible. Today, there are a small group of cutting-edge teams developing this technology, each with a unique method (and patents pending). CineMallTV aims to be the best by being the easiest & most-intuitive platform, and by securing partnerships with the most stylish TV shows in the US, UK and Germany. 

For entertainment industry executives, this is a new and potentially massive revenue stream (as commissions are divided between content providers & CineMall for each sale transaction, the similar revenue to model to Amazon.com.

To date, no outside investors have been involved. Legal fees & software development have been paid out of pocket. The first prototype has successfully passed testing, and the development team is currently working on a fully functional version. 

Team profiles, business plan, offering documents & software demo are available upon request.

"US1000001E60","Knightscope, Inc."," 	 		Crime has a $1+ trillion negative economic impact on the US each year and it will only worsen with the continued increases in population, strains on municipal budgets and volatility around the world. We cannot wait to react when it happens - we must get in front of it and address the issue NOW! 		 		Knightscope is developing technology that will predict and prevent crime with an innovative combination of large-scale robotics, predictive analytics and social engagement. 		 		Imagine a friend that can see, hear, feel and smell that would tirelessly watch over your corporate campus or neighborhood, keep your loved ones safe and put a smile on everyone passing by. Imagine if we could utilize technology to make our communities stronger and safer…..together. 		 		Introducing the Knightscope K5 	 	 		The Knightscope K5 Autonomous Data Machine utilizes a combination of autonomous technology, robotics and predictive analytics to provide a commanding but friendly physical presence while gathering important real-time on-site data with its numerous sensors. 		 		Data collected through these sensors is processed through the K5's predictive analytics engine, combined with existing business, government and crowdsourced social data sets, and subsequently assigned an alert level that determines when the community and the authorities should be notified of a concern. 		 		If an alert is pushed, the K5 machine will turn on all of its sensors to not only allow the entire community to review the data, but to contribute important real-time information. Our approach alleviates any privacy concerns, engages the community on a social level to effectively crowdsource security, and provides an important feedback loop to the prediction engine. 	 	 		Knightscope’s quickest avenue to commercialize the K5 technology is in outdoor environments at corporate campuses, shopping centers and with private security companies. Tedious and monotonous monitoring will be handled by the K5 leaving the strategic, “hands-on” activities to security personnel. 		 		Knightscope has also received numerous inquiries proposing a variety of use cases where the K5 would make a positive impact. These offer substantial future growth opportunities in areas including, but not limited to, schools, hotels, auto dealerships, stadiums, casinos, law enforcement agencies, seaports and airports.

Literally.

Sweaty socks get stashed next to a clean shirt packed for Happy Hour. A damp, mildewing
swimsuit tangles itself around a water bottle. Everything snarls together inside one dank,
unorganized, germ-breeding compartment.

And the worst part?

You put up with it. Accept it. Adapt to it. You somehow overlook the fact that a crucial piece
of equipment that’s supposed to support your fitness journey is actually nothing more than an
inconvenient, dysfunctional bag. One that’s rapidly becoming a genuine threat
to your health. And that’s a real problem.

But it doesn’t have to be…

Apera means revolutionary fitness bags. Intuitively organized, impeccably constructed and
healthy by design.

Suntek’s newest product is Cloud Gel, a unique glazing material that automatically controls the amount of light and heat let in through skylights. It makes skylights less expensive than electric lighting by eliminating air-conditioning costs.    	 Suntek's Low-E is an invisible coating on windows that reduces heating and cooling costs, thus saving 3.7% of world energy - as much as all wind and solar electricity. But it was developed and marketed for 0.1% of their costs. Popular Science magazine called Low-E “one of the 100 most important inventions in the last 100 years.”   	 Currently, skylights are energy consuming, unreliable sources of illumination because the amount of light they let in depends on how bright it is outside. Cloud Gel makes skylights a reliable and practical source of illumination by keeping the amount of light they let in constant throughout the day and from winter to summer. This eliminates air-conditioning costs on hot days, which makes skylight illumination cheaper than electricity. Cloud Gel skylights can be 60% the size of normal skylights and provide the same illumination. This pays for the Cloud Gel, so it is effectively free.

"US1000001EC0","M Lite Solution LLC","M-Lite has 5 basic revenue streams that produce prosperity:

1) M-Lite Solution LLC manufactures LED Lighting products that are the most cost effective LED lighting solutions in the marketplace for schools, and commercial properties. We specialize in LED Retrofit kits which is a niche market where we have no comparable product competition with our US patented designs.

2) We offer the World's Best Hydroponic Grow Light, it is a full spectrum 4 channel controlled unit that out performs a 1000 watt HID while consuming 350 watts. It is a high end, yet value priced product that out performs others that are 3 to 4 times the retail amount of ours. The hydroponic grow market is an understated market, and with the legalization of cannabis in some states it will continue to rise. 

3) Specialty lighting manufacturer - We build the Holiday Tree Topper aka Star of David for last falls ABC Shark Tank winner. We are currently manufacturing them for the upcoming Holiday Season.

4) Grow Illinois Project - We have taken the leadership role to train and provide jobs for our returning veterans, and communities in need. We have our own proprietary farming system that takes Hydroponic farming to the next level with our vertical grow units . Of all the thing we do, this is a GAME CHANGER on a global scale. 

Here's why:

An average acre of traditionally farmed land will earn a farmer between $20,000 - $30,000 per year. An average acre of hydroponically grown crops will earn between $200,000 - $250,000 per year. Our  process allows us to do more with less space.

We can take 1125 units and produce 2.9 million plants per year in 54,000 sq.ft. This is a little more than an acre in comparison. We produce between $20,000 - $43,000 annually per unit. At maximum harvest we would generate a gross profit of 48 Million within a few years time.

5) We are also a brain trust that consults and solves green energy related problems using our veteran engineering know how.","EquityNet","Commerce & Industry","Industrial Equipment","Industrial Equipment & Components","Wauconda","IL","US","http://www.m-lites.com","http://www.equitynet.com/c/m-lite-solution-llc","Equity","Closed","2014-06-27 17:43:41","2014-06-27 17:43:41","FALSE","2500000.0","450000.00","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"US1000001EDD","C-Note , (NewCo)","As a Musician, Serial Entrepreneur, Creator, Gadget Junky and terrible golfer I felt the need to combine these traits into a product that would bring me personal satisfaction, incalculable wealth AND improve my game.
VOILA!
The C-Note Putter. A Putter to End ALL Putters!
Whats so special about the C-Note Putter?      Tuning!
It is designed to be; in fact it is, a variation of a tuning fork. It is cast from a seldom used very hard, very 'brittle' metal alloy. When the ball is struck correctly it produces a perfect 'C' note. It's not so much that a G or an E would not work just as well, but C is the right note to match the size and shape of the design without having a large glob of metal at the end of your shaft. I also intend to establish a retail price of $100.00 (a.k.a.  C-note) It all works together nicely. Clever don't you think?
Even better, it is a one direction fits all design. Whether you are left or right handed the precision milled mirrored faces will produce the same beautiful C-Note as long as you hit it just right. Other benefits include:
  • It has perfect Balance - left or right
  • Great conversation starter
  • It has perfect pitch
  • Set the note to start your group singing at the 19th
     .....way better than Karaoki

How many can we sell? According to research conducted by Putting Theorist and Instructor, Geoff Mangum, on Putter Sales, the golf putter market is about $150 million a year, which is about one-third of all ""individual club"" sales, which is in turn about one-seventh of all golf equipment sales. Millions of putters sold annually - not one having any better logic than the C-Note Putter - in my opinion! The amazing C-Note Putter is better in fact since the C-note has a soothing frequency that is in perfect harmony with Zen and Feng Shui and Nature itself, thereby allowing the user to retain their confidence and calm and still have as many clubs in the bag at 18 as at tee off.","EquityNet","Services","General Entertainment","Gaming Activities","Blaine","WA","US","http://www.equitynet.com/c/c-note--newco","http://www.equitynet.com/c/c-note--newco","Equity","Closed","2014-06-30 16:52:31","2014-06-30 16:52:31","FALSE","350000.0","","","","","","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/dorn-beattie/21/738/64","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

What Sets Us Apart  	Tier 1 Exchange is the only platform that provides unified access to data on European banks and the European banking industry. Also, we have devised a proprietary market based rating system for assessing banks, which will revolutionise the bank investing industry.   Our Keys To Success  	We are looking to raise capital from a select, private pool of investors so that we can build a specialised secure platform that can host our banking data.

"US3000001EFC","Pinion Pins"," Why We Started This Company  	 The company was launched to address a specific market need. Pinion Pins are multi-use, industrial strength products that bind various fabrics or flexible materials together for storage, solutions, and security. We use the same technology that similar magnetic devices such as security tags use to create a strong, protective hold while not damaging the surfaces to create a solution that surpasses all existing technologies in this market.   What Sets Us Apart  	 Our patented technology set us apart from competition. Our product is much smaller, less intrusive, safer on the hands (can be handled by children), and made from higher quality materials. In addition, our magnetic remover is specialized to interact only with this product. At a specialized Tesla level, the magnet is able to open the pin (normal magnets cannot), while at the same time, it cannot be used to open store security tags and other such things.   Our Keys To Success  	 We have a multi-use product that is simple and technologically cutting-edge. We ran TV campaign through CNBC, Kare 11 news, as wells as HGTV, which reaches 891,477 hits within the month program. We have hit three independent retail stores with six unique locations and are continuing to expand. We are also in the midst of testing in Bed, Bath and Beyond, as well as Home Depot, and Walmart.

Our technologies  just  changed the electric motor/generator world forever ushering in a new era in how we think about electric machines...An entirely new technology utilizing different principles than all previous  electro-magnetic machines to date!. Incredibly  efficient, far more powerful, absolutely dead quiet, completely fault tolerant.Linear Labs Magnetic Tunnel Saturation designs offer extremely high flux confinement and flux densities allowing unparalleled conductor field saturation using conventional magnetic materials technologies.  Unlike all machines used today the smallest current is turned into a motive force. No current is consumed to establish a electro-magnetic field and there are no alternating magnetic poles thus best power factor available.. As near to unity power factor as it is possible to get!
So what does all that mean? Extremely high efficiency across the entire rpm/torque range, not just at one point on a graph. Electric vehicles that don't need new battery technology to get gasoline equivalence. Industrial motors that respond instantly to changing loads and continue to operate after a fault.

Linear Labs has produced technologies with the following attributes:
1.	Technology that is Proprietary and Patentable.  Patents pending on all technologies , 
         (Base technology claims awarded by PCT/EPO, entering country phase).
2.	Technology is Greenfield IP – Not like any other motor – differentiators are evident
3.	Technology that can replace existing technologies in existing and extremely large markets
4.	Technology focuses on a concentration of clearly defined major customers:  1 sale = large $
5.	Technology is a glove-fit for several large-cap global corporations, who are potential acquirers
6.	Technology that can be licensed, and utilize existing customer infrastructure to manufacture
7.	Technology that has been reduced to practice 4 times; 3rd party data confirms it works

King Cayuga Vodka is made on a farm with organic local white wheat from the Fingers Lakes and spring water that has naturally flowed through limestone. Through the use of state-of-the-art technology in conjunction with old world techniques, King Cayuga is developing the best vodka in the world.  
 
The Name and Logo

King Cayuga Vodka gets it's name from being produced in King Ferry, NY right next to Cayuga Lake.  The royal logo of a duck fitted with a crown pays homage to the Cayuga Duck, found only in the Cayuga Lake area.
 
The Distillery

The distillery has received Double Gold and an award for ""Best Vodka"" from the New York International Spirits Competition. Likewise, it produced the alcohol used in the brand that won Double Gold and ""Best Vodka"" in the San Francisco World Spirits Competition. By using only local organic ingredients, a controlled slow fermentation system, as well as a complex distillation and filtration process that takes place 10 times, King Cayuga is creating the purest and best tasting vodka in the world.

Creating The Vodka

Vodka this good has never been on the market before. King Cayuga Vodka is made with the utmost care and patience, making use of all new technology and machinery. While some vodkas only ferment for three days, King Cayuga rests for two whole weeks in a controlled high-tech tank. This results in a much purer alcohol before it is filtered.
 
Environmentally Friendly

The wheat that goes into King Cayuga Vodka is 100% natural, organic, and local, conveniently situated on the same farm that homes the distillery. Any waste that is produced from the production of vodka is recycled into the farm for use. Also, the bottles are sourced from the fingers lakes area, less than an hour away.

"US2000001F6A","Tropical New Construction in the Florida Keys"," 	 This is a pre-funded new construction opportunity for a large single family home located in the town of Marathon on Grassy Key, Florida. The developer purchased the double size lot on 8/3/2012 with his own funds for $40,000 and recently began construction by using $60,000 of his own funds. In addition, the developer will pay approximately $12,000 in points and closing costs out of his own funds. The appraiser estimates 16% of construction has been completed to date with site excavation, concrete pilings, and exterior walls complete. The developer is requesting a loan in the amount of $140,000 in order to complete construction and prepare the home for rental.   	 There will be 3 disbursements scheduled during the construction period. The first will take place at closing for $40,000, the second for $40,000, and the third for $60,000. Each will be disbursed upon evidence of work performed and verification by site inspection from an appraiser. The terms of the loan allow for the developer to request an extension of up to an additional 6 months beyond the 12 month term (for a total possible loan duration of 18 months), if needed. If an extension is requested, we will charge the borrower 2 points and split the points with investors. Once construction is complete, the developer will obtain conventional financing to pay off this loan.   	 An independent third party appraisal commissioned by Patch of Land shows an After Repair Value (ARV) of $500,000 which equals a Loan To Value (LTV) ratio of 28%.

The three largest pain points with  mobile payment adoption by consumers  that even Apple Pay and PayPal have not overcome are:

1.	According to Gallop Poll  security fears are the number reasons people are not using them (55% of the 17,000 surveyed).
2.	According to an article in Forbes over 84% of the small businesses have not adopted the a mobile payment system because cost of new equipment. Therefore, there is limited places consumers can use a mobile wallet.
3.	According to Fortune "" Access to loyalty rewards from brands is the most wanted features from consumers, and it’s the one least integrated in mobile payments today,” notes Forrester Research analyst Thomas Husson, in a recent blog about this topic. Indeed, approximately 57% of U.S. adult smartphone users want access to loyalty programs and rewards through mobile wallets, according to his firm’s ongoing Consumer Technographics surveys.

Then there is Nudipay who has addressed these pain points with Nudipay;

1.	No security issues because none of your identifying information is stored on the app or transmitted to the merchant.
2.	Small business owners will adapt Nudipay because there is no cost to join, no need to purchase new equipment and no monthly fees. The only pay per transaction with an affordable 15 cents flat fee.
3.	We have two built in loyalty. One from the merchants to their customer and one from Nudipay to our consumers (just like a reward credit card).

We plan to launch in two U.S. cities Denver, CO and Portland, OR.  One of the reasons being that their is a large undeserved market in these two keys cities that can boost Nudipay's launch.

My passion is to reverse climate change through greater awareness of alternative fueled vehicles. I want to reduce our dependency on foreign oil by providing green vehicles to people who do not own their own vehicle. FunRide offers cars, pick-up trucks and vans that save our customers money and let them drive the latest green vehicle.   What Sets Us Apart  	 Most carsharing services are offered in large cities where many residents do not own a car. FunRide offers a wide variety of vehicles that are alternative fuel or hybrids. FunRide has been successful in San Luis Obispo County and we are ready to spread our service to other medium sized markets in California. Our customers can reserve the vehicles online and they gain access into their reserved vehicle with a fob. They return the vehicle and our staff clean and fuel the vehicle.   Our Keys To Success  	 Carsharing is a new concept in medium markets, but it a great alternative to traditional car rental company. Customers can become members of FunRide to use the vehicles on a regular basis or can rent on a one time basis without paying an annual membership fee. We can place several vehicles in a community and monitor the activity from our corporate office. We can contact hourly employees to clean and fuel the vehicles.

The best part of Automotive Lift Service is that it has been operating since 1986.

But, despite their newfound potential, many indie teams fall short when it comes to marketing.

What Sets Us Apart  	While many game development groups focus primarily on creating large-scale games that sustain millions of users over extended periods of time, we focus instead on leveraging marketing insights and celebrity/brand partnerships to create viral periods of gameplay tied to trending moments in pop culture. Underscoring everything we do is our commitment to developing mobile games that educate, entertain and inspire the 100+ million Americans who play them.   Our Keys To Success   	The core formula for our success is creating games that are as appealing to the stereotypical gamer as they are to the passive smartphone user who only occasionally downloads apps.

They’re teaching you how to make your product, service, and business better. Yet customer feedback seems to be an afterthought to most businesses. As a result, only 4 in 10,000 customers currently provide feedback. We started Wyzerr for people like us who want to share feedback regularly with a business but don't want to spend 15 minutes filling out a long survey.   What Sets Us Apart  	  Wyzerr collects more data in a shorter amount of time than any other customer feedback survey out there. It’s a platform that is more consistent with the digital age of today: fun, fast, and easy. By making our feedback process look and feel like a game, Wyzerr can obtain up to 20 detailed answers in under 60 seconds. Aside from our interactive user experience, our secret sauce is the technology. We ping customers with a Wyzerr survey while they are still in the store at point-of-sale.

Without the financial strength to hire employees and an inadequate location to, our growth was unsustainable. So we decided to formulate a plan for sustainable growth and success. We found that the  issue with the drone industry is that there isn't a place where a user can purchase a professional drone that is truly ready to fly. The successful introduction of the DJI Phantom proves that this market aches for solutions that don't require a lot of technical skills to operate. Farmers, surveyor, 3D mappers and the need of many other professionals are not being met. That's where Urban Drones comes in. We have now pivoted to serve a bigger market. Instead of offering parts to the DIY community, we're offering fully ready to fly drones for the agriculture, surveyor, industrial inspection, film, 3D mapping and many other industries. We're curating and integrating new and evolving technologies into fully ready to fly drones. There are thousands of developers creating drone hardware and software solutions. Many don't get traction because their inability to offer these solutions as ready to fly products.

"US1000002058","KRS Capital LLC"," 	Why We Started This Company    	After spending several years on Wall Street with UBS and The Bank of Montreal, Managing Member Kaya Robert Suarez realized there was a need for independent investment managers without the typical conflicts of interest associated with the major banks and brokerages. Furthermore, most investment managers focus on just one of either value, momentum or macroeconomics. In response, Mr. Suarez founded KRS Capital LLC in 2013 to provide unparalleled investment management services to its investors.    	What Sets Us Apart   	Unlike most investment managers, KRS Capital combines a thorough understanding of 1) value, 2) momentum and 3) macroeconomics to generate superior returns for its investors. While most investment managers focus on just one of these three key drivers of financial markets, irrespective of the market landscape, KRS Capital leverages its flexibility across value, momentum and macroeconomics to ensure its investors are always in sync with the ever-changing market landscape.    	Our Keys To Success   	Having spent several years on Wall Street in UBS' Equity Capital Markets Group, UBS' Asset Management Investment Banking Group and Bank of Montreal's Asset Management Investment Banking Group, KRS Capital knows financial markets.

When co-founder Ivana Lo Stimolo had finished reading Anne Fogarty’s Wife Dressing, The Fine Art of Being a Well Dressed Wife she couldn’t help but feel a special connection to Anne. While certain parts of the book have a vintage flair about them most of the advice dished out is still very much valid today. Anne’s opinionated views of fashion, attention to detail and use of quality materials resonated greatly with the Milan native. 
After a few discussions about the book and Anne’s design career with her partner Greg Halvorsen it wasn’t long before he had scooped up the rights to the Fogerty label. By September of 2013 Anne Fogarty, Inc was once again a registered corporation in New York with it’s headquarters less than a mile away from Anne’s original atelier. By January the company had both a design team and a production agreement in place. 
The new Anne Fogarty collection will not follow the traditional fashion calendar but will be offered in 6 mini capsule collections over the year; one every two months.  The reason for this is it allows more flexibility to meet changing consumer patterns and creates a certain level of urgency: buy now or you will not find it later.  It also provide the opportunity to introduce more unique collections, such as a holiday dresses in November or summer dresses in July.  
The mini collections will be sold on line via proprietary editorial content, such as our own magazine.  The fact that Anne Fogarty was relevant and designed for over three decades provides a wealth of material for publishing and marketing purposes.  The online store will be incorporated into the published material instead of a traditional online store format. To compliment the online sales the company will look for a brick and mortar partner, such as a department store or national apparel chain.  The partnership could be exclusive so as to provide a seamless experience for the customer between online and in-store shopping.

"US2000002082","Fleetic","We started the Fleetic project with three main goals in mind. The main goal and driving force  was a desire to improve on what was already available in the social media market. Our second goal was to offer a learning tool with potential applications in high school and university environments. The last and the most important, was to build on existing technologies to provide more accurate, direct and private exchange of information, if you like. What really excites us, is the possibility to offer an interface with greater user side customisation (which fall within our terms of use conditions).

Pragmatik IO is past completion of the prototype that’s meant to complete an actual response to these Industry challenges. Our methodology is the missing link to the defense-in-depth strategy of active-defense. To respond with as much force exerted by an attacker is turned back onto them in equal force, similar to the Japanese Aikido martial art. Every CISO over the past twenty years has asked for the above answers to make business operations better. We are finally delivering our game changer, after all you have the right to fight-back within your digital backyard and private property.

Our network security system sits between each endpoint across the network, shifting your IP driven user workstations and endpoint devices throughout the network. “Akin to the constantly moving Grand staircases at Hogwarts the school for wizards in the films, Harry Potter"". Attackers never before have been confronted with a Gauntlet placed before every possible point and strep across a victim enterprise. They will fail to understand the enterprise is gaming them just like the 'street corner hustle of ""cup & shells game"" where our instrumentation is the hustler and the network devices are our hustle. An attacker will never be able to predict where a device will appear next... crippling attacker tools fundamentally designed around static targets for over two decades. Attackers will be unable to map your networks, maintain covert connections, or spread across the network with the ease afforded to them for over two decades. Our network security engine Cyberflage(tm) will protect networks by making the advance of the attacker unbearable.

"US30000020B9","Parrable"," 	Parrable is a revolutionary mobile advertising platform with a proprietary, cookie-less tracking system (IP filed) that empowers advertisers for the first time ever with enhanced targeting, retargeting, and attribution on mobile web.  Parrable's technology is disruptive to mobile advertising in its use of data to find, buy, engage, measure, track, and personalize messaging to consumers on their mobile devices.  This innovative technology can enable programmatic trading on mobile web, allowing new levels of efficiency in the industry and driving revenue for both the buy and sell side of the digital advertising landscape.  Parrable's Hawk API is a highly scalable product based upon Parrable's robust technology foundation that can easily be integrated into any existing advertising platform and publisher's mobile site.   	Not only does Hawk allow attribution, targeting, and retargeting capabilities it does so in a non-invasive and consumer friendly way.  Any information our tracking methodologies collect is first party information provided by people - at no point do we buy personal information through 3rd parties or collect Personally Identifiable Information (PIIs) such as names, phone numbers, or emails.  Not only that but we believe in absolute transparency not just as a buzzword but as a business model.  We allow anyone to go on our privacy page and not only see exactly what information is linked to their mobile device but we offer them the ability to change that information or opt out of our tracking system forever.  We believe that when people see that we truly only collect information that makes their mobile web experience more personal they will enthusiastically opt in and tell us more about what they like, but our opt out is easily accessible and it works.   	What all this means is that through our proprietary tokening technology we can finally offer advertisers programmatic mobile buying.  Our method is more accurate than cookies, less invasive than cookies, and works across publishers enabling a more personalized and relevant experience for consumers wherever they go.  Its not just better for the consumer - our tracking offers levels of actionable marketing insights to the industry and brand advertisers that have never been seen before in any advertising space - not just mobile.  we don't just believe that this technology will disrupt the mobile advertising world - we believe it has the potential to disrupt the advertising industry on every level, and change the game forever and for the better.

"US20000020BE","Philly Single Family Rehab"," 	     	We have committed to pre-fund this purchase and rehabilitation opportunity on Friday September 12th for an attached single family brick rowhouse in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The developer is highly experienced and has worked previously with Patch of Land.   	The developer is purchasing the property from an estate for $150,600 and is contributing $55,600 (36.92%) towards the down payment. The property currently is in need of significant renovation throughout with a preliminary estimated renovation cost of $72,000, inclusive of labor and materials. The expected renovation time frame is 12 weeks. The cost of renovations may increase based on upgrades, and additional funds are in place to cover a potential budget overrun.  There will be 3 disbursements associated with this loan. The first disbursement takes place at the closing in the amount of $110,000. The second and third disbursements of $45,000 and $40,000, respectively, will be released upon evidence of work completed and title rundown. The developer requests a loan in the amount of $195,000 to cover the remaining purchase and closing costs, renovate, and prepare the property for resale.   	An independent third party appraisal commissioned by Patch of Land shows an As Is Value of $152,000 and an After Repair Value (ARV) range of $315,000-325,000. Based on the appraisal and our own research and due diligence, we are comfortable with a value of $320,000, which equals a Loan To Value (LTV) ratio of 60.94%.

MuviChip fills the void left by traditional physical media and current digital solutions in an increasingly mobile world.

MuviChip is a one-of-a-kind USB drive that contains a DRM (Digital Rights Management) protected file of a movie.  Only MuviChip delivers a fully portable and accessible entertainment experience to the mobile consumer without the limitations of DVD, Blu-ray, downloading and streaming.

"US10000020CA","Emerald City Beer Company LLC"," 	Emerald City Beer Company (ECB) is fanatical about creating the Seattle Lager—a style, culture and taste that is Seattle beer.   	Across America, the craft beer industry is flourishing!  Washington State, most notably Seattle, is a top 5 craft beer market  that is under supplied with local lagers, ranking 11th as a state in breweries per capita.   	Most beer served in the US today is a lager style, pilsner, however, most craft beer is focused on ale styles.  Ales are a flavorful and bold contrast to lagers, but are certainly not intended to be crisp &amp; easy drinking like pilsners. ECB makes craft lager beer for those who want it all, flavorful &amp; easy drinking!   	ECB primarily targets the young and social crowd, individuals with an active social life, and often stressful professional life, who frequent a wide range of venues for entertainment including, restaurants, bars, sporting events, concerts, outdoor activities and various community events.   	ECB has some exciting goals for the next year! We currently offer a year-around lager, and two of four planned seasonal lagers. Our year-around lager is the only style available today in 16oz aluminum cans. The plan for the next year is to release the final two seasonal lagers and put all four of the seasonal lagers into cans. We'll then release a variety pack of ten 16oz cans that includes all five different beers styles and 4-packs of the individual style when in season.   	ECB currently contracts the large production batches of beer with another local craft brewery in Western Washington. This allows ECB to better focus resources on building demand for our beers, instead of investing in supply assets that make them. In the next five years, we aspire to reach 15k barrels of annual production, qualifying us a regional craft-brewery. At these production volumes, it'll make sense for ECB to either sell it's brands to a larger brewer, or to build-in it's own facility, so to recapture the production margin for our investors.

Enrsave became an authorized Philips distributor in May of 2014 by convincing Philips management that our unique online/offline market approach could increase their long term share of the residential market for LED lamps. Philips is currently limited to Home Depot in the physical retail space and online lamp catalog sites such as bulbs.com and 1000bulbs.com. In Home Depot, Cree and store brand LEDs are Philips main competition. None of the current market channels educate the consumer sufficiently to make the best choice of LED for their application. 
Enersave is in discussions with environmental organizations to team to introduce their members to LED lighting in order to reduce electric bills, lower their carbon footprint and combat Climate Change.  Enersave is also recruiting independent agents, primarily college students, to distribute coupons and door hangers for a fee and a sales commission on sales their efforts generate.  Our goal is to achieve a minimumof 1000 agents, primarily in the higher electric cost regions of the US.  Each agent will be able to sell our products using our app and a card reader in addition to distributing sales literature.
www.myLEDhome.com will ship Philips LED products from its fulfillment partner direct to consumers and accept back incandescent lamps and CFLs containing mercury for proper disposal using our delivery packaging for the return.  Pilot distribution of door hangers and flyers is underway in New York City and New Jersey. Management believes that information about the residential purchasers of LED lamps from www.myLEDhome.com will have additional value to future partners who sell green electricity and installers of solar electric systems.

"US20000020DB","Rehab in Charlotte’s Art District"," 	        	This is a pre-funded cash out refinance and rehabilitation opportunity for a single family property in the NoDA arts district of Charlotte, North Carolina. The developer is highly experienced and has worked previously with Patch of Land.   	The property is need of moderate repairs which are expected to be complete within 3 months. The developer purchased the property on August 5th of this year for $130,000 with his own cash. The estimated cost of renovation is $31,760, inclusive of labor and materials. The developer requests a loan of $125,000 to refinance, renovate, and prepare the property for resale. In order to effectively monitor the loan, there will be 3 disbursements associated with it. The first one is to take place at closing in the amount of $75,000. The second disbursement will be in the amount of $30,000 upon evidence of 50% of the work completed. The final disbursement will be in the amount of $20,000 and will be released upon evidence of 100% of the work completed.   	An independent third party appraisal commissioned by Patch of Land shows an As Is Value of $142,000 and an additional After Repair Value (ARV) report of $181,000 which equals a Loan To Value (LTV) of 69.06% and is in line with the data we found during our due diligence process. However, the developer is confident, due to the quality of renovations and market activity, that the property will be valued at $210,000 at the time of resale. This would indicate an ARV of 59.52%.   	Our research shows that the residential market in this community of Charlotte, NC has been stable recently and currently supports an upward trend in property values.   	Current average Days On Market (DOM) is 1-6 months. When we include the rehabilitation time frame of 12 weeks and 30-60 days to close once the property is under agreement with a new buyer, the expected loan duration is 6-8 months.

"US10000020DD","Uni-Control, LLC"," 	We are a small boutique mining consulting firm assisting small to medium size mining companies structuring their operations to reach the export markets. We offer technical, commercial and financial support. Our holistic approach allow us to package solutions that meet requirements of the off takers. Due to the inherent conservative nature of large corporate companies, they do not extend themselves to take supply side risk.  On the other hand the miners being new do not have the banking support to collateralize on payment instruments when they sign contracts with steel mills. This leave many miners seeking high and low for bridge funding (purchase order funding) to service contracts. As we understand the risk and management of these deals, we are in a unique position to profit from these transactions  provided we can provide the purchase order funding. By supporting the miner we can offer a full service deal structure for the end buyers, similar to then they buy from large mining companies.   	This involves our company taking the Letter of Credit from the end buyer and processing it, to extend an LC to the miner, an LC to the shipping company and then control all payments based on delivery of tested and cleared minerals to a free trade zone where we can take title to the product in smaller volumes while paying the miner based on smaller volumes delivered. This provides oxygen to the miner and allow them to work with us to manage the delivery of large contractual volumes that they otherwise would not be able to service. Once we have 90% of the minerals under our name we call the vessel which implies a 20% mobilization fee. Once the vessel is loaded, we can claim the buyers full LC. This purchase order funding approach can generate 10 to 30 USD/MT depending on mineral type. Based on 35,000 to 100,000 MT per month resulting in revenues streams in excess of 350,000 USD/shipment.

In recent years, kayaking has become an ever increasing past-time, not just for extreme sport enthusiasts, but for everyday individuals. Women and men of all ages have picked up the sport as a true hobby. While the market has grown significantly in recent years, a major drawback to the kayak has always been its portability. A full sized kayak measures ~12ft in length and can weigh anywhere from 30lbs-80lbs. For individuals without access to a large vehicle or expensive attachments, the thought of transporting a kayak is complicated; that's where Oru Kayak comes in.   	  Fueled by his love of the great outdoors and inspired by an article covering the art and science of origami, Oru Kayak's Founder and CEO, Anton Willis, began sketching ideas for a portable and lightweight kayak that could offer the functionality of a full-sized kayak but be easily transported and stored when not in use.   	  Willis initially performed user tests on countless prototypes in varying conditions including bays, lakes, rivers and oceans.

"US2000002119","Accolade Brands, Inc."," 	 Why We Started This Company    	 The partnership of Whispering Dove and AccoladeBrands was formed one night while drinking and enjoying a very pricey Napa Cabernet Sauvignon. The intensely fruit forward taste of this fine wine turned south on us as we calculated how many hours of work we had to put in simply to afford that wine! This epiphany led us to take our significant wine industry experience, and look for great sources for grapes from vineyards that have critical acclaim and status. That night Whispering Dove was hatched.   What Sets Us Apart  	 The Whispering Dove winery was founded with the purpose of returning to the California wine lover both quality and perspective. When purchasing Whispering Dove, you will be afforded the same advantages of an ultra premium, cult quality, Cali wine without the disadvantage of subsidizing a wine producer’s extravagant lifestyle. Rather than pay for airplanes etc., Whispering Dove drinkers will pay for the finest grapes, grown in in the best micro-climates and produced by the finest winemakers.   Our Keys To Success  	 Whispering Dove works with the finest winemakers, consultants and vineyards to deliver a cult quality wine that is somewhat more affordable than more established names. We are a lean producer, without the capital investment of winery and vineyard to add to the pricing of our wine. That being said, our wines start at $55 per bottle and go to $75.

"US1000002147","GreenSpace Enterprise Technologies","The company that I’m raising money for (owned by my holding company Aisling Enterprises, LLC) is GreenSpace Enterprise Technologies.  GreenSpace is a hardware/software suite aimed at enterprise organizations looking to gain more insight into their facility utilization.  For example, Company A has facilities around the globe.  They currently send a person with a clipboard up to each floor 3 times a day to try to gauge how often rooms and desks are used, how many people are using the rooms and try to derive utilization rates from that information.  Obviously, this leaves much to be desired.  What about if someone just left the room?  Or, what if they just entered the room after the clipboard carrier just walked past?  How do we know if they used the projector or flat panel display?  They gain no insight into that information.  GreenSpace will allow them to see which rooms are used, when they are used, how many people are in the meeting (in the event 2 people are consistently holding down a 20 person conference room, etc.), and will allow them to shut down a projector or flat panel remotely in the event no one is in the room thereby saving energy and projector lamps.  The big seller is the ability to use the metrics on the back end.  Facility managers now have complete visibility as to how, when and where their space is used.  They can even see if the projectors and flat panels are being used.  There will be no more guessing as to how many meeting rooms are needed and what size they will need to be.  There will also be little debate as to whether or not they need more displays.  Once they have the utilization rates of all of that in front of them they’ll be able to make informed decisions.","EquityNet","Services","Professional Services","Professional Services, Other","Miamisburg","OH","US","http://www.equitynet.com/c/greenspace-enterprise-technologies","http://www.equitynet.com/c/greenspace-enterprise-technologies","Equity","Closed","2014-10-02 17:45:17","2014-10-02 17:45:17","FALSE","150000.0","70000.00","","","","","https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=25239270&trk=nav_responsive_tab_profile_pic","","http://www.twitter.com/jasonmterry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Company’s proprietary development is called MuviChip, and it enables consumers to watch entertainment on their smartphone, tablet or computer without downloading, streaming, or managing storage space. MuviChip fills the void left by DVDs, Blu-rays, downloading and streaming in an increasingly mobile world.   What Sets Us Apart  	MuviChip is a one-of-a-kind USB drive that contains a protected file of a movie. The movie on MuviChip can be played on almost any mobile device, and movies purchased on MuviChip are added to the consumer’s digital library. FlixChip Corp. has also developed ChipTab and Muvifi.

Despite current surgical techniques and advanced surgical hardware, further clinical advances are needed to reduce the number of incomplete unions, provide faster fracture healing, and greatly reduce the need for secondary interventions and additional surgeries. The company is initially focusing on spinal fusion surgical procedures to aid in the complete fusion of the targeted vertebrae, which currently has only a 70-75% success rate with the first surgery.   	BiologicsMD’s lead program is a patented, recombinant fusion protein (PTH-CBD™) that has a proven and potent profile in bone osteogenesis, and is being developed to facilitate spinal fusions in degenerative disk disease and reduce the number of incomplete fusions (pseudarthrosis). PTH-CBD™ is a unique biological fusion of the active sequence of teriparatide (Forteo®, Lilly) which is approved for treating severe osteoporosis, and a collagen binding domain (CBD), which is a component of the targeting sequence for a collagenase/XIAFLEX® (Auxilium) and is approved for Dupuytren’s contracture – both Forteo® and XIAFLEX® are FDA approved drugs.   	One of the unique features of the the product is that it can be delivered with any bone matrix material applied during the fusion procedure and will provide sustained osteogenic/anabolic effects that last greater than 6-9 months with a single application. In addition, based upon recent preclinical data, the targeting effect provided by the CBD component of the therapeutic delivers the product to type l collagen, thereby limiting systemic concerns – a problem observed with daily injections of teriparatide (Forteo®).

During this time we have been busy amassing a voluminous slate of commercial production properties (nearly 70).   We have tested the waters with one or two sales along with one test production.  

This year marks our first year officially entering the fray.  Mission Pictures covered and loves ""Shepherd"" our faith-based in-house product written around HOT faith-based selling elements.

Finding Kate Middleton - A UK based comedy

Documentaries:
Secret Sins: Untold Stories of U.S. Military Veterans  - Veterans Documentary
Sex Film Secrets  - Behind the scenes adult film tell-all

With such a large inventory of commercial properties, our immediate goal is financing.  We are working with Pacific Mercantile Bank which provides unlimited access to production funds through their lending model.

At the crux of this model is collateral represented by either private equity, pre-sales, production incentives, or a combination of the three.

Scaling back - Projects mean nothing without  distribution.  Distribution is not possible without production.  Production fails without financing.  All roads lead back to financing. 
Once our coffers are filled internally, we will finance our own productions just like the bigs/mini-majors.  

Our films range from $1.5-$25M budget-wise, with potential earnings of $25-$50M (not including VOD, telco, satellite, DVD).   This matrix represents roughly $1.75 billion - $3.5 billion in potential sales revenue.  The margins are incredible.

The developer is highly experienced and has funded 3 other projects through Patch of Land.   	The property is in need of a complete gut rehabilitation project. The developer is purchasing the property for $56,550  and providing $20,000 as down payment. The estimated cost of renovation is $80,000, inclusive of labor and materials. The developer requests a loan in the amount of $115,000 in order to renovate and prepare the property for resale. There will be 2 draws associated with this loan with an expected renovation time frame of 20 weeks. The first draw will take place at closing for $88,000. The second draw of $27,000 will take place upon completion of the project and contingent upon a third-party inspection.   	An independent third party appraisal commissioned by Patch of Land shows an As Is Value of $56,000 and an After Repair Value (ARV) of $175,000 which equals a Loan To Value (LTV) ratio of 65.71% and is in line with the data we found during our due diligence process. However, due to the strength of the market and increasing appeal of this area adjacent to the NoDa Arts District, our developer will be marketing the property at $200,000. Our research shows that the residential market in this Charlotte, NC community has been stable recently and currently supports an upward trend in property values.   	Current average Days On Market (DOM) is 3-6 months. When we include the rehabilitation time frame of 20 weeks and 30-60 days to close once the property is under agreement with a new buyer, the expected loan duration is 8-11 months.

In order to comply with GMP manufacturing and globalize, we have established a new company in the US; all IP (patents, data, know-how) and licensing rights belong to the new company, where operations & manufacturing are now under the direction of an experienced US team. There has always been a critical shortage of blood worldwide; as the population grows & ages, that shortage will grow. Many people outside of the US are told at the hospital to get friends & family to donate blood but it often arrives too late, and there is no inventory on hand.  Perftoran (to be rebranded as Vidaphor, meaning life-bearing) is completely artificial; it is not hemoglobin based. It does not need to be matched to blood type, saving time & resources; its use virtually eliminates the risk of viral transmission (not all countries screen donors to the extent that we do in the US) and unlike blood, which expires in 4-6 weeks, the shelf life of Perftoran is 3-5 years when stored frozen; adverse reactions, some of which are very serious and can result in lengthy hospital stays and even death can occur following a blood transfusion, while there have been very few serious reactions reported after more than 30,000 exposures.  The majority of recipients of Perftoran (88%) have had very good results; mild to moderate adverse reactions have occurred in 4% of recipients, the majority of which have been transfusion reactions (flu-like symptoms, flushing).  Our first market is Mexico, where we will relaunch the rebranded product; thereafter, we will expand throughout Latin America under mutual recognition agreements with Mexico.  In 2005, the market for whole blood was valued at >$7B.  We also have 3 other products whose potential market sizes are equal to or surpass that of artificial blood.

The industry, which generates at least $10B annual revenues, has not materially changed in 40 years and is characterized by minimal product differentiation and lack of innovation.   	HUBB provides an exciting development in a market that is ripe for disruption. The Company has already successfully deployed and piloted their 5 inch filter for light trucks and vans and will be ready to deploy their 3-inch consumer oil filter and industrial 13.5-inch filter in first quarter of 2015. These filters differ significantly from the traditional oil filter: they increase oil flow to the engine by 5x that of a traditional oil filter, they are 99% efficient in removing contaminants of oil (compared to 52% with traditional filters), and their increased engine performance helps reduce emissions by up to 30%. The oil filters can be used over a vehicle's full lifetime and thus pay for themselves (cost breakeven is often realized in as little as 12 months). The product also enables the potential elimination of the 400M oil filters that are discarded every year and millions of gallons of oil that ends up on our roads and in our waterways. The Company offers a strong IP portfolio, an experienced management team, and a high potential for the disruption of a large and established market.

PONTiS’ mission is to develop and commercialize innovative systems to improve upper and lower extremity orthopaedic surgery. Our unique stainless steel cable and crimp technology simplifies and speeds the surgery, provides repair options not previously available – and produces a repair with higher strength.  	FDA has cleared our initial application – flexor tendon repair in the hand/finger – and we expect clearance for biceps, Achilles and other tendons and ligaments shortly. Our fundraising will provide resources to commercialize these systems in the US and internationally   	Tendon repair is challenging surgery, especially with today’s less-invasive techniques. Tendons must be intact to allow joints to flex and extend actively. Due to natural tension, the ends of a severed tendon become separated by a gap – preventing healing.  	The suture-based techniques currently used by orthopaedic surgeons to repair a tendon gap have not advanced in over 30 years – requiring multiple suture-passes through the tendon fragments and complex knots to produce a repair with sufficient strength for healing, and may later elongate, re-forming a gap.  	The PONTiS system is strong, prevents a gap from developing and simplifies the procedure   	1. Our system is easy to learn – simple, straightforward, reliable and reproducible results. 	2.

Gyms are filled to capacity and demand is growing at exceptionally high levels. As a business model, owners enjoy an extremely high gross margin and a very low overhead. Only a few staff are required to check in hundreds of customers each evening, facilitate parties and groups, and climbing routes are changed on a regular basis through contracted setters. 

Investment opportunity is for a tract of commercial real estate with development of the nation's first purpose-built bouldering gym, financed through an SBA 504 loan. Estimated payback in Year 2.

We have located a very affordable plot of light-industrial land in the central part of an untapped, booming market. The city of Happy Valley is the fastest growing city in the state of Oregon at over 7% annually. Over 250,000 people are without easy access to a commercial gym. Potential customer market is estimated at over 90,000 individuals and families. Rare opportunity exists to build the country's first ground-up, purpose built facility for bouldering. As such, The Edge expects to be recognized as one of the nicest and most professionally designed bouldering facilities anywhere.

Projected membership base after pre-sale is 375 and 1400 by the end of Year 1. Projection model based on real industry data and professional consulting from a leading climbing wall builder in the United States.

"US1000002215","First Choice Green Solutions","First Choice Green Solutions (FCGS) is seeking investment up to $5M to meet current demand and development efforts on multiple opportunities. To date, FCGS has three (3) existing long-term contracts worth $45M. Incepted in 2013, FCGS began as an offshoot of First Choice Tree Service; a tenured green waste management company, serving Southern Nevada for the last two decades. FCGS was created to handle logistics, preparation and delivery of various waste streams in customized form as feedstock for Waste-to-Energy technology. Through Waste-to-Energy technology, most waste can be used as renewable feedstock to produce thermal and electrical energy in modular, on-site locations. FCGS has worked closely with Integrated Energy Solutions (IES) on a high profile Department of Defense Waste-to-Energy project for the last three (3) years. IES was the first to use the pyrolysis process as a solution for converting all forms of waste to energy. Recently, FCGS acquired IES and is pleased to complete our turnkey offering through the addition of the actual Waste-to-Energy technology that we currently provide feedstock and plant maintenance for. Our vertically integrated capabilities allow us to utilize municipal solid waste, woody biomass, medical waste and tires as feedstock; providing a clean, net-zero energy product, greater local energy security and lower GHG emissions. FCGS provides waste handling, landfill diversion, recycling, waste-to-energy (design, build, operate, own, maintain) and O&M services. We are able to perform each of these services alone or in any combination to meet specific customer needs. Integrated Energy has received all Air Permitting approvals.  The Air Permitting and Environmental is in the most stringent Air Quality Management District (AQMD) in the US, located in Southern California.","EquityNet","Energy","Green/Clean Technology","Alternative Energy, Other","Las Vegas","NV","US","http://www.firstchoicegreensolutions.com","http://www.equitynet.com/c/first-choice-green-solutions","Equity","Closed","2014-11-04 00:23:41","2014-11-04 00:23:41","FALSE","7500000.0","2500000.00","","","","","","http://facebook.com","http://twitter.com","http://plus.google.com","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Spartan 3  is an elite cybersecurity organization with deep domain expertise in cybersecurity, physical security, risk mitigation, training and advisory consulting targeting the $180B cybersecurity market. 

Cybersecurity is the process of applying security measures to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of critical data. Cybersecurity assures protection of assets, which includes data, desktops, servers, buildings, and most importantly, humans. 

S3’s combination of expertise, proprietary solutions and technology—reinforced with our dynamic risk and response teams—help mitigate the impact of any cybersecurity breach. We identify and stop advanced attackers at every stage of an incursion. 

Spartan 3 delivers innovative, holistic, comprehensive and proven solutions to broad industry including government, law enforcement and military.

Spartan 3 does this through a synergistic blend of three category-winning services:

•	Cybersecurity
•	Physical security
•	Advisory consulting

In today's complex digital landscape, challenges are rarely one-dimensional. As the complexity of threats increase, organizations are more vulnerable now than ever before. As more and more organizations expand their presence and engagement online; ecommerce, social media, dynamic websites, cloud storage, web based applications, SaaS, smart devices, WIFI, SCADA, C4IT systems, personal wearable devices and more, an organization, its customers and employees are dangerously at risk to cyber criminals, adversarial nation states, hacktivists, hackers, unsuspecting, negligent, and sometimes, criminal minded employees and staff without the right partner.  

Spartan 3 is that partner.  Simply put, the cost of cyber risk is astronomical and prohibitive to the 21st century organization. If not mitigated, the impact is disastrous. Just ask JP Morgan Chase, Anthem, Target, Sony, ARAMCO and others.

"US100000228D","FUELogistics, Inc.","FUELogistics has developed an advanced crude oil upgrading and pre-refining process that is specifically designed to tackle the difficult task of upgrading some of the most problematic crude oils found throughout the world. The Low Profile Fluid Catalytic Cracker, nicknamed the LP-FCC, is a transformational technology that opens a new era of operational flexibility, making crude oil upgrading at or near the well-site an economical and profitable reality.

For over 65 years, large Fluid-bed Catalytic Cracking (FCC) technology has been used in complex refining operations to convert low grade crude oils into more valuable petrochemicals and motor-fuels such as gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. Until now, with only minor improvements, conventional FCC technology has remained relatively unchanged. Our LP-FCC now challenges the status-quo by introducing a new and innovative modular design that cost 60% less to build than a comparable FCC unit. It’s much smaller footprint and multi-reactor process delivers higher operating efficiencies and profit margins, while also providing a clear competitive advantage because of its economical ability to scale down to smaller operations.

From an investment standpoint, what sets this particular opportunity apart is that our supply chain of raw materials (crude oil) is in abundance and contractually secured, our LP-FCC production process will be ready once construction is completed, and every drop of product we produce can be sold at top dollar to downstream refineries. In addition, we have the top petroleum engineers and management team in place, the project has been approved by all state and federal regulatory agencies, ground has already been broken and the initial foundation laid. 

What more could you ask for in an investment? We invite you to take part in America’s energy boom and join our team and efforts to help bring this technology to the world and our nation to energy independence.

This property is located within the pastoral Trout Valley located 49 miles northwest of Chicago. The loan term for this project is 9 months.   	 The Hertz family originally built this property back in 1902, where two Kentucky Derby horses were trained. More recently it has been a private preschool. The Developer is renovating this property back to a single-family residence to sell when completed.   	 The developer is purchasing the property for $135,000 and requesting a new loan in the amount of $320,000, which will cover the purchase, holding costs and a renovation budget of $219,360.  Patch of Land will hold approximately $29,200 for an interest reserves account to cover the monthly mortgage payments for 9 months of the loan. The construction budget of $219,360 will be disbursed in 3 equal draws. The first draw will be disbursed at closing of escrow; the second and third disbursement will be released after rehabilitation goals have been met.  Approvals for each draw will be based on reports generated by our third party inspectors and clear title rundown.   	 An independent third party appraisal shows an As Is Value of $180,000 and an After Repair Value (ARV) of $596,000. *Please note: After the appraisal was completed, the borrower decided to build a 2-car garage instead of the original plan of a 3-car garage. Thus, using the line item adjustments derived by the appraiser, our Underwriting team has re-adjusted the ARV to $591,000 to properly reflect the change in value. This revised appraised value equals a Loan To Value (LTV) ratio of 54.15% which is in line with the data we found during our due diligence process.

"US10000022BE","FUELogistics"," 	FUELogistics has developed an advanced crude oil upgrading and pre-refining process that is specifically designed to tackle the difficult task of upgrading some of the most problematic crude oils found throughout the world. The Low Profile Fluid Catalytic Cracker, nicknamed the LP-FCC, is a transformational technology that opens a new era of operational flexibility, making crude oil upgrading at or near the well-site an economical and profitable reality.   	For over 65 years, large Fluid-bed Catalytic Cracking (FCC) technology has been used in complex refining operations to convert low grade crude oils into more valuable petrochemicals and motor-fuels such as gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. Until now, with only minor improvements, conventional FCC technology has remained relatively unchanged. FUELogistics' LP-FCC now challenges the status-quo by introducing a new and innovative modular design that cost 60% less to build than a comparable FCC unit. It's much smaller footprint and multi-reactor process delivers higher operating efficiencies and profit margins, while also providing a clear competitive advantage because of its economical ability to scale down to smaller operations.   	FUELogistics is a mid-stream crude oil upgrader and has targeted Utah's oil rich region in the Uinta Basin to begin its initial push into the mainstream of the refining industry. In so doing, it is solving a major land-lock and transportation challenge that has plagued oil producers of heavy and viscous crudes for decades. From an investment standpoint, what sets this particular opportunity apart is that our supply chain of raw materials (crude oil) is in abundance and contractually secured, our LP-FCC production process will be ready once construction is completed, and every drop of product we produce can be sold at top dollar to downstream refineries.   	What more could you ask for in an investment? We invite you to take part in America's energy boom and join our team and efforts to help our nation become energy independent. We have the top petroleum engineers and management team in place, the project has been approved by all state and federal regulatory agencies, ground has already been broken and the initial foundation laid, now all we need to succeed is your support to bring operations online and make our financial projections a reality.

"US1000002319","Bimici Enterprises","As an Ecommerce / Internet Marketing Manager professional I have a deep understanding, with practical application, of these skills  that are extremely important with my new business. I have also worked in the wholesale store fixtures and display arena, and increased my former employer's from $235,000 in 2009  in sales to 1.3 Million in 2011.

With this business, I plan to make some very profitable changes, such as,

1. In the beginning, I will source my products from overseas, instead of ordering through drop-ship intermediaries.
       One example is. My former employer would order the products from middlemen  and mark the price up extremely. I have a slideshow that shows  outsourcing will allow me to sell a large product, purchased for $700 (includes shipping), for $2,500. My company's profit would equal $1,800. This is a big advantage, because the middleman sells this same product to my former employer for $2,800, who then marks it up 3,700 - This achieves a $900 return on this one product.

Future plans include opening  two more businesses under the Bimici Enterprises. The size of the large building I want for the wholesale store fixtures, will allow for these two additional companies to start up without additional cost fora building to operate in.

Of course, my focus at this time is  the wholesale store fixtures business.

"US100000231F","Armory Fuel Inc."," 	Why We Started This Company   	Armory began as a small fuel oil dealer. What we realized, however, was that our competition relied heavily on market pricing from the wholesalers within their own geographical market. Many of these smaller firms failed to hedge their oil cost throughout the season. We knew that we could find a way around this problem to increase our margins and remain competitive throughout the region.   	What Sets Us Apart   	Many small firms exist to provide Home Heating Oil (HHO), diesel fuels, and gasoline. These firms are generally five-man, single-truck enterprises that are heavily reliant on their local fuel wholesalers, who often times form an oligopoly of necessity. These small firms lack the equipment and people to source and store fuel from a wider network of wholesalers. Armory seeks to develop a highway fleet and storage facility to allow the sourcing of the most competitively priced fuels. Our management has a background in futures contracts and appropriate hedging strategies in the fuels industry, and we plan to leverage this experience to widen our margins upstream.   	Our Keys To Success   	Armory's ability to utilize a highway fleet and on-site storage means we can purchase fuel at an unbeatable price point from anywhere in the region. Our size and prepayment practices will make us eligible for discounts that smaller firms simply cannot access. This translates to the most competitive price point for our customers.

- Causal Online Home Shopper
- Working with an agent
- Submitting an offer on a home
- Opening Escrow
- Selecting a loan
- Closed on a home
- Moving into a home
- Living in a home
- Remodeling a home
- Refinacing a home

Vendigi's patented-protected method for harvesting digital audiences along with exclusive and proprietary relationships with the source of Real Estate data - brokers, Multiple Listing Services (MLS) and top tier property data companies allow Vendigi to offer digital audiences currently unavailable. MLSs are the backbone for 80% of all real estate transactions. Vendigi provides a complimentary platform to the MLS for real estate brokers to monitor consumer engagement with their listing content. The platform demonstrates the marketing value of the MLS to their customer, the real estate broker. In return, Vendigi granted exclusive access to harvest and monetize broker, buyer and seller audience data. 

Once harvested, advertisers (The Home Depot, Wells Fargo, Time Warner Cable, etc.) that offer services around home purchase/ownership pay for Vendigi's digital audience data. The audience data when used in online campaigns allow advertisers to put their ads in front of the right person (home buyer, seller or owner) at the right time (financing a home, buying a home, selling a home, just moved into a home, remodeling a home, refinancing a home, large equity in a home, etc.).

Vendigi is the first to harvests broker and agent digital audiences from their source system, the MLS. This allows advertisers (Zillow, Trulia, Realter.com, etc.) with products and services aimed at real estate professionals the ability to target these audiences as never before.

Simply put, Starter Rocket wants to be the booster that launches project into orbit.

First up for Starter Rocket, is the never-before-seen ice spectacle, Armageddon On Ice (see  Products and Services for detail). AOI is designed to play secondary markets in mid-size sports arenas with an average capacity of 6,000 seats; these markets mirror the markets of the American Hockey League (AHL) and the East Coast Hockey League (ECHL). Together, these two leagues draw over 9,000,000 fans annually, and we plan extensive marketing and outreach campaigns to build brand awareness in advance of the shows.

By avoiding large seat arenas and major markets, and not carrying the big cost of name bands and ice performers, we are able to produce a show that is reasonably priced, and designed for growth. We estimate that we can keep our ticket price to $30 for our first tour cycle, and that we will need roughly 2,700 people per show to break even. We believe we can exceed those numbers, and that, with merchandise sales and sponsors, we can be profitable in our first year. 

We are planning a showcase event at the DCU Center in Worcester, MA in November 2015, and a 10-show leg in spring 2016 in the Northeast and Midwest. Our goal is to be global by 2017, and to present approximately 50 shows annually.

Dating is Difficult.  A while back I was having a tough time with dating and a friend helped me out.  He introduced me to one of his Facebook friends that he thought I had a lot in common with.  A long story short, within a few years of a first date, that girl became my wife.

This story originated the idea for SparkStarter, a mobile app making it easier to play matchmaker for your single friends.

I’m Tony Kramer CEO and Founder of SparkStarter.  We took the common concept of meeting through a friend and put matchmaking into a mobile app.  SparkStarter is a place where we encourage everyone (even those in a relationships) to join and play matchmaker for single friends.

How does SparkStarter work?
1.	Login through Facebook
2.	Decide to play matchmaker for friends or search for yourself
3.	After browsing matches, vote up to notify the user
4.	Once both users show interest in each other by both voting up, they are allowed to send a message to each other

The online dating market is competitive.  We will win in this market because we are focuses on a target audience that often gets overlooked – the friends of single people.  By engaging friends to help out, we believe we are tapping into market of online dating that currently doesn’t existing.

After 4 months of beta testing, we have 500 users that are using the app on average 8 minutes per day with over 2.5 million data points collected.  We’ve are averaging about 30 matches (page views) per user a day.

SparkStarter’s mobile app will be available on Google Play as well as iTunes coming January 2015.  We are seeking an angel investment of $250,000 to help grow this disruptive product in the online dating space.

SparkStarter  - we didn’t invent the concept of meeting through a friend, we just made it easier.

"US1000002353","AVACEN Medical"," 	The concept for AVACEN, which is an acronym for Advanced Vascular Circulation ENhancement, grew out of research to help those suffering from chronic migraines.   	We found a thyroid treatment protocol that was raising core body temperature using T3 hormones which produced the unexpected benefit of relief for migraineurs.   	Thus began the quest to understand core body temperature manipulation. This led to published research which described a process whereby putting the hand in a slight vacuum while applying heat to the palm could transfer that heat into the circulatory system thereby influencing core body temperature.   	We later discovered that continuing to infuse heat into the circulatory system after the body reached normothermia produced some widespread and exciting results.   	Trying to understand why no one had previously made a similar discovery, we came to realize that, except for the intentional creation of hyperthermia to treat cancer, the primary purpose for infusing heat into the circulatory system was to move hypothermic people to normothermia. Therefore, when the body reached normothermia, the job was done and there was no need for further warming.   	The Company's recently patented AVACEN Treatment Method (ATM) continues infusing heat into the circulatory system at normothermia.

By opening this new center LSPC will be able to provide at the beginning approximately one hundred and fifty to one hundred seventy five units of plasma per month to our local community within the first year.  By year four we will be able to provide five to six thousand units year and by year ten upwards of fifteen thousand units of plasma not only to the Kansas City area, the United States and even throughout the world.   	The main target audience for donators will be from the age of 18-40.  With the secondary target being of the ages 41+.  All donators will be compensated for their donation.  The current compensation package is $25.00 for the first donation and $35.00 for each additional donation thereafter.   	The current market value for one unit of plasma is set at $900-$1200 in the local Kansas City area.   	Plasma is a necessary part of the medical field that is only produced by the human body and cannot be synthetically reproduced.  As the population increases so does the demand for blood and plasma.  It is safe to say that the future of plasma is only going to grow and the demand increases each and every year. We are currently seeking a business loan for the amount of $840,500.00 to cover the startup expenses to include remodeling, equipment, first 5 months salaries and expenses.  We are confident that within the first 6 months of business the company will be profitable due to the high need of our product.

"US300000239F","ValorCon LLC"," 	ValorCon is a new video game and tabletop game convention in downtown Chicago. This type of show has been very successful in 2nd-tier city markets like Boston (PAX East), Seattle (PAX Prime). Research indicates that gaming is still on the rise, nine years after a boom in 2006. The PAX shows sell out in advance very quickly, indicating the market is not saturated. Further research indicates that their target demographic is not regionally distributed, and that the larger a local population is, the greater the odds of success for this type of show. New York and LA would be logical targets for the next such event, but Chicago, as the #3 population center in the US, is more attractive since it would not compete regionally with either PAX event. Our expectation, based on an analysis of similar start-up ""fan""conventions, is to hit 5,000 attendees in year one, double that in year two, and then settle into a 20%-30% growth rate until we hit 40,000-50,000 unique visitors, probably in 2019-2020.

"US30000023BB","Liquidity Spot, Inc."," 	We are an online marketplace which is a two sided exchange.  On our supply side, we serve institutional investors who have excess or idle cash who seek higher returns than comparable cash equivalent returns.  On the demand side we serve independent mortgage lenders who need short term funds to finance the mortgages they originate from time of funding until sale to the permanent loan investor.   Our online exchange makes it simple for the mortgage lender to upload a data file of collateral that they wish to use to obtain financing.  The loan data and the collateral trust receipt are uploaded into our proprietary exchange system, X-Spot™.  Once the lender submits the collateral for financing bid, X-Spot™ validates the data through a network of internal and third-party data providers.  We also incorporate CoreLogic’s LoanSafe product which appends to the collateral data file a Collateral and Fraud Risk score.  These scores as well as any of the collateral data is searchable and filterable through X-Spot™.   On the supply side, an investor simply funds a trust account and completes one or as many bid profiles they desire.  Bid profiles are simplistic yet they have the ability to be as granular as the investor desires.  These profiles determine which collateral is eligible for a bid from the investor.  The investor bids a desired participation percentage, a cash advance percentage and an interest rate.  All of this can be done globally or at an individual transaction level.   X-Spot uses proprietary algorithms to match credit profiles and participation bids.  The lender is provided three choices – optimize for cash advance, optimize for interest rate or utilize X-Spot’s proprietary optimization.  We also have a third party who provides first loss coverage on the loans providing further credit protection for the investors.  On a risk return basis, our current annual yields of ~3% to the investor are far superior to other liquid cash alternative in the marketplace.

Because of the fragmented nature of the market in its current state, the threat from competitors is not necessarily a negative reality, and additional competitors in the market help increase awareness and drive overall sales, leading to more acquisitions and industry consolidation.

These improvements, which are still ongoing, consist of paving, landscaping, power washing, new pool furniture, complete clubhouse renovations, tennis court resurfacing and the installation of pet parks.  These improvements have helped achieve greater rental increases than are already occurring to existing residents, and also help attract future residents willing to pay higher rents than before. As we continue to push rents, our first class management style will maintain the efficient occupancy levels we’ve exhibited since taking ownership.Colony has implemented aggressive measures to increase ancillary income streams not previously tapped.  Since acquisition, we have developed a new utility reimbursement program that provides ongoing utility revenue.  We’ve also leveraged our industry relationships to strike a lucrative deal with local cable providers that provides ownership with an ongoing stream of cash from cable.  The utility reimbursement program will add new annual, recurring revenue in excess of $318,000 and the cable revenue sharing program will add an additional $42,000 per year in recurring revenue.

"US1000002413","Pipeline Wizard"," 	 Why did you start Pipeline Wizard?   	 Pipeline Wizard (www.pipelinewizard.com), founded by Jesse Garcia, Rochelle Garcia and Praneel Kumar, was created to assist real estate sales professionals set prospecting goals, track lead generation activities, map conversion ratios and produce ""result metrics"" pertinent to the agent's business.   	 The idea was born when Jesse closed his first real estate transaction. With a desire to understand how his commission check was calculated, where each fee was distributed and how much he should budget for taxes and business expenses, Jesse began to sketch out formulas to help keep track of every action and every penny. As his business grew he needed to track more in-depth data in relation to past, current and future transactions for budgeting and business planning. Jesse further analyzed income projections, production trends and sources of business. One key equation in this application is tax budgeting. From the beginning of Jesse's real estate career, his CPA advised him to set aside a certain percentage of each commission for quarterly tax payments so he wasn't surprised or playing ""catch up"" in the third or fourth quarter. By incorporating these strategies and implementing this system Jesse's business became more predictable and stable.   	 What problem does Pipeline Wizard solve?   	 Pipeline Wizard is an interactive business solution built to increase productivity and profit through accountability and competition. Real estate agents and sales professionals, which number millions worldwide, will all benefit from Pipeline Wizard.   	 Anecdotal data and surveys suggest that a majority of real estate professionals do not track their business and the professionals who actually do so, typically utilize a whiteboard, spreadsheet or paper. Pipeline Wizard is a simple, cloud-based solution which allows the user to increase production, set goals and manage the pipeline while enjoying up-to-date technology.   	 In addition, sales professionals are generally very competitive and we see an opportunity to embrace this natural drive to win through developing a platform for which they can compete with other agents/sales professionals with the by-product being an increase in production.

"US1000002426","Arisone Home Health Care, Inc.","Arisone HHC offers a unique approach to the ever-growing Home Health Care industry.  We of course offer the typical in-home care services (companionship, basic personal care, pet care, laundry, etc.) but our approach to utilizing a limited number of well-compensated care givers eliminates the revolving door approach to home care.  This concept allows us to provide for more consistent, competent and compassionate care. The overall business concept focuses on franchise sales opportunities throughout the United States.  Our home-based structure minimizes overhead costs that can be utilized on marketing, sales and business development efforts.  This home based concept also opens the door to those looking for affordable franchise opportunities.  Without an extraordinarily high initial outlay, franchisees can concentrate on building their business, finding quality care givers and providing superior service. Once the Flagship operations are running in full force the company will turn its efforts toward franchise sales.  After that, we will develop the Health Care segment and begin selling separate franchises in the skilled care arena. Our founder is a Swedish national resident and is self funding the entire operation.  As such, it is difficult for us to secure traditional funding through banks or financial institutions.  Therefore, we are in search of a limited amount of funding to continue toward our goal of developing the concept in the United States. At this time we are fully licensed and insured and have already brought on our first clients.  We are simply in search of a limited amount of working capital to continue the marketing and business development efforts throughout 2015.","EquityNet","Healthcare","Patient Care","Home Healthcare","Broomfield","CO","US","http://www.arisone.com","http://www.equitynet.com/c/arisone-home-health-care-inc","Debt","Closed","2015-01-29 20:29:24","2015-01-29 20:29:24","FALSE","750000.0","200000.00","","","","","https://www.linkedin.com/company/3611504?trk=tyah&trkInfo=tarId%3A1410808211395%2Ctas%3Aarisone%2Cidx%3A2-1-2","","","https://plus.google.com/114075979830943663482","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The WellMetris Profile is NOT a diagnostic. It assesses the metabolic status of an individual rather than diagnosing a specific illness or condition, as medical diagnostics do. The WellMetris Profile is a pre-clinical screening and monitoring tool to rapidly and inexpensively assess the wellness of large groups of people - employees, pension fund beneficiaries, government dependents, and so on.   This tool is used by wellness consultants, intervention specialists, accountable care organizations and insurers to focus early intervention and preventative programs toward those in any large group that will benefit the most, BEFORE a particular condition progresses to the point where more costly medical intervention becomes necessary – promising to shrink healthcare expenditures and delivering healthy outcomes.  WellMetris testing technology is derived from costly and complex laboratory-based biomedical research and clinical tests.  The real breakthrough is in the conversion of these expensive lab-based tests to non-invasive, urine-activated tests performed in less than 3 minutes for less than $24 in office, shop or retail settings.

Mobile EMR is the first-ever cloud-based app specially designed for allowing medical and response staff to quickly and easily gather personal medical data especially in emergency situations. Wherever you are and whatever happens, you can be prepared—Mobile EMR could save your life.   	No matter how much we try to avoid it, accidents happen and they happen swiftly and unexpectedly. In these cases, patients may not be able to readily provide pertinent medical information that could be vital to their treatment and care.   	Whether they are in shock, unconscious, in pain, or simply confused, patients will not always be ready with the right and accurate information that medical response personnel need to have. These personal medical information include medical history, medications, allergies, symptoms, as well as emergency contact information. Gathering all these take a while. Thus, EMS, 911, fire, police, hospital doctors offices, day care, dentist offices, schools, and other first aid givers may have a delay in administering necessary help and treatment.   	To help speed up the process and cut down valuable time, we have created Mobile EMR. Which allows patient app to talk to other electronic medical records and vice versa.

The addressable market for wearable technologies specific to smart apparels in fitness and wellness is estimated to reach $2.3B by 2017 (IHS Electronics &amp; Media, 2013).   	Pain: Today's wearable technologies are bulky, uncomfortable to wear, require charging and not all-weather proof – not suitable for integrating into apparels. Most wearable devices are abandoned after a few months. For fitness and wellness, the sensors and applications lack granular fitness analytics (e.g. continuous heart rate monitoring function) and incentives to drive behavior change (fitness &amp; wellness).   	Solution: Sensilk is the only integrated silicon &amp; textile apparel solution today that wears like traditional garments but provides comprehensive monitoring functions such as ECG/EKG, respiration and body temperature.

We believe our Software should be smart enough to learn, predict and then create it's own programming and lead the worldwide internet of things into the next decade.   	  What Sets Us Apart   	  EM&amp;N8 executive staff was the first of only two Mac Software companies to develop CD/DVD/Blu-Ray mastering software from the ground up for the computer industry.

"US300000244B","Create"," 	 Create was conceived in late 2011 by Stefan Martinovic and Ed Switzer, childhood friends who grew up to build careers in real estate development and city planning. Stefan came from the hedge fund world where he was parked in front of a Bloomberg terminal for hours a day before breaking into real estate. As a developer, he spent years driving around the neighborhoods of DC scouting for properties, collecting data from dozens of sources, and building spreadsheets to understand the investment economics.   	 Coming from a planning and project management background, Ed spent his days using GIS systems and design tools to understand the physical feasibility of projects, but wanted a deeper understanding of the business end of the building industry. The two combined their talents, and after 18 months in concept development, resulting in a patent filing and turning down a very early buyout offer, Create was materializing.   	 A chance LinkedIn encounter led to adding Laura Ferguson as CTO to lead the charge on the engineering side. Stefan moved to San Francisco to kick down doors in Silicon Valley, while he continued to grow a 10-person organization based in DC and the Bay Area, with alumni from organizations like Apple and NASA. When screenshots of the product started to surface, hundreds of groups from top real estate firms, investment banks, government agencies, and universities flooded Create with requests for access to the product, which has launched in DC, with plans to expand to Detroit and nationwide.   	 Create is an operating system for real estate and economic development, representing an entirely new software category for the building industry. Like SimCity for the real world, Create is built around an immersive 3D map of the entire city that is packed with building and property data including structural, ownership, residential and commercial market, construction cost, tenant, financing, transit, zoning, city planning, environmental, and demographic data sets which are constantly updated through live feeds from 3rd party partners.   	 Create's SaaS platform allows developers, investors, brokers, and individuals to model any property investment instantly and filter across multiple databases to pinpoint the best opportunities in the city. In a few clicks, users can generate site-specific 3D building feasibility models reflecting local regulations, along with all of the accompanying financial information including budgets, schedules, operating statements, monthly cash flows, investment returns, and economic impact studies.

There is a large and profitable business opportunity taking the CO2 and delivering it to agricultural fields, orchards, plantations and vineyards to reduce climate change.

AG Gas is a whole new, profitable gas industry that addresses pressing global issues offering sustainability for generations to come.   	What Sets Us Apart   	AG Gas innovation taps existing global markets of crops, orchards, vineyards and plantations to monetize, profit and sequester large amounts of CO2 gas.

Many global regions are experiencing acute freshwater shortages. In California, 80% of the water goes to agriculture and is then lost to the atmosphere through the leaves.

We will private label the Petron Plus product line under our own brands for industrial equipment, cars, weapons oil, the trucking industry and shipping and aircraft industries. 
 
In addition to the ability to market the private-label products, JIMG will incorporate the use of these products in its own Gun Functionality Service Agreement and a Mechanical Breakdown Service Agreement for high mileage automobiles, trucks and other gas and diesel-powered vehicles and equipment. 
 
JIMG will be able to capitalize on the 35 years worth of Petron Products use and supporting performance data and testimonies from government entities and Fortune 100 companies for entry into these markets. Current sales of the products mainly to military and government agencies is estimated to be $500M, this represents 0.25% of the $200 billion lubricant market. 
 
The growing demands to improve efficiency of operation and reduce emissions and waste have created a need for these products. The products supplement current products in use rather than replacing them. The effectiveness and claims of the products have been verified by an independent international-testing lab and verified as containing no toxic or hazardous chemicals by the EPA and European agencies. The products are a unique nano-hydrocarbon product that affects the metal surfaces, providing a continuous high-strength layer of lubricant that remains even after the oil is removed. In an extreme test, gasoline and diesel engines treated with the product have been run without oil in the engines for hours without damage or overheating of the engines

"US3000002475","AlgiSys, LLC"," 	Overview: AlgiSys is a biotechnology company that produces high-value omega-3 fatty acid nutrition ingredients from microalgae. AlgiSys is currently developing proprietary microalgae strains to be used with proven biotech production methods and intellectual property for one important fatty acid, EicosaPentaenoic Acid (""EPA). EPA is a long-chain omega-3 fatty acid, or ""good fat"", that has clinically proven cardiovascular system and joint health benefits. AlgiSys' renewable resource-created products can replace or enhance EPA omega-3 oils derived from the world's primary existing, but limited sources—fish and fish oil. Furthermore, current dietary sources of EPA are inadequate relative to daily recommended levels. AlgiSys' vegetarian EPA oils can be quickly adopted by customers because they mirror existing conventional fish and non-fish-sourced oils. AlgiSys' EPA oil will address the major Omega-3 markets, which represent a multibillion dollar opportunity. Initially, the Company is focused on selling its products into the supplements markets, and subsequently into the animal feed and the more-regulated food &amp; beverage/pharmaceutical markets.   	The Company's technology platform consists of proprietary technology in areas such as microalgae, fermentation and downstream processing. The Company is working to further develop and optimize proprietary strains of microalgae that produce oils rich in EPA via a fermentation process. AlgiSys, in conjunction with its development partners, is actively commercializing its technology platform and significant milestones have been met: (i) technical feasibility has been established; (ii) intellectual property and trade secrets have been developed; (iii) fermentation process parameters have been improved and developed for the initial strain; (iv) the biochemistry and genome is better understood; (v) tools for classical strain improvement have been developed and deployed; and (vi) a culture collection of derivative strains with high EPA production characteristics is being produced and evaluated.   	The Company will use standard fermentation and downstream processing equipment to efficiently scale and accelerate the production of EPA oil. By feeding its proprietary oil-producing microalgae sugars or other low-cost feedstocks in fermentation vessels, the Company is utilizing proven and cost effective biotech production processes, in contrast to more expensive, unproven and less efficient open-pond and photobioreactor approaches used by the Company's potential competitors. Using industry standard fermentation vessels, AlgiSys can create a controlled environment that prevents contamination and allows for tight regulation of key production parameters to maximize yields.

"US100000248F","Urban Power USA"," 	Urban Power USA is a new company founded in Western Massachusetts which manufactures and sells a new type of vertical wind turbine called the Urban Turbine.   	Our turbines are unique in design and patented. The turbine is a drag style turbine which means it does not need smooth fast moving air required by traditional blade type turbines. This characteristic imparts a significant advantage over traditional wind turbines because it means they can be installed in the city environment where smooth air is difficult to find. In addition to not requiring smooth air, our turbines cannot move faster than the wind is blowing, therefore it is not capable of generating the noise or vibrations as traditional turbines do. The large urban market has been under served for renewable energy due to the limited products capable of operating there.   	This opens up a unique niche by making it perfectly suited for large and small flat roof tops building installations in the city where the customer need the power. The roof top installation is cheaper and uses space which typical is not used to generate an income. Urban power USA enjoys a large customer base which other renewable energy sources are ether not suited for the location or too expensive to utilize. Our target markets are any flat roof building or open land with at least modest to good winds anywhere in the US or the world.   	Even though our turbines command the low wind environment, we also excel in the high wind areas. Unlike traditional turbines our turbines do not shut down during high wind situations. Instead we have a unique system that kicks in an additional inverter system to act as a break by generating addition electrical production.   	Another feature of our turbines which is one of the best in the industry is the installation and shipping process. We do not need any special shipping requirements so we can use standard shipping methods so trucking costs are kept low. Installations of our turbines are just as easy because all turbines are assembled on site and do not require a crane for placement on a roof. This significantly lowers the cost of installation.

"US30000024B3","XpresSpa"," 	 Company highlights include:  #1 market position with tremendous growth opportunities. XpresSpa created the airport spa business model and largely defines the category; the company serves over a million customers per year and has 4x the number of locations of its largest U.S. competitor. The brand is coveted by both airport operators and the traveling public alike. XpresSpa is on the cusp of a major inflection point, as it is has positioned itself for geographic expansion as well as increased sales per location. The company plans to net open 15 locations in 2015, which represents a 30% increase over last year. Its existing spa sales, which have seen an acceleration in same-store-sales growth in 2014, are poised to continue trending higher through the launch of an innovative line of personal care products for the prestige traveler. Operating a spa in an airport environment is difficult because of regulation, training, branding, and managing surge traffic; these phenomena create significant barriers to entry against competitors. Best in class retail economics with established infrastructure to execute on rollout. XpresSpa’s average unit volumes and variable labor costs produce attractive store margins and best in class cash on cash returns. The typical payback period for a location and average lease time, allow for each unit to produce several years of strong cash returns. The Company’s management, systems, and processes are in place to expand the chain. The XpresSpa business model is established, working, and replicable. Large, growing, international market: The airport retail renaissance and increasing spa visitation by consumers are the foundation for XpresSpa to continue its unit and same store sales growth in the future. Airport concessions are a $5 billion market annually, and the industry is growing ~6% per year. As an industry leader, XpresSpa has built an expertise in identifying the most attractive locations within the space. Despite its leadership position, the company has identified multiple dozens of large and medium sized US airports, as well as multiple dozens of large international  for expansion. Ability to invest alongside sophisticated private equity fund: Mistral Equity Partners, a $300 million fund that specializes in consumer and retail transactions, is the majority owner of XpresSpa. The Company’s funding needs for 2015 are wholly underwritten by Mistral. Mistral’s CEO, Andrew Heyer, is an investor in OurCrowd’s general partnership and an active participant in the OurCrowd community.

"US10000024B5","Bat Blue"," 	Company highlights include:   	A new, better approach to high-performance cloud security. Highly distributed corporate infrastructure and increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks have rendered traditional on-premises security products and internal IT support ineffective. Though migration to cloud services represents one of the fastest growth segments, it is unsupported by physical products and first-generation cloud security vendors rely on approaches that don't offer comprehensive protection and levy speed penalties. Bat Blue has developed the first cloud security solution sophisticated enough to offer a cloud service as an alternative to security infrastructure. Bat Blue's service can be implemented in hours, not weeks or months, delivering uniform security across all of an organization's Brick &amp; Mortar, Cloud &amp; SaaS, and Mobile &amp; IoT platforms.    	Significant customer traction and demonstrated efficacy.  With minimal funding to date and a lean sales team, Bat Blue has built its 2014 revenues to $3.5M and a customer base of over 20 companies spanning sizes and industries, including tumblr, Disney, ESPN, NYSE Euronext, and FiveThirtyEight. Bat Blue’s platform has already been put to the test – successfully defending its clients against very high-profile attacks by mercenary hackers, state-sponsored, and hacktivist groups with successful track records against named targets, including many well publicized commercial and government networks.   	Experienced CEO and high caliber advisory team: Founder and CEO Babak Pasdar has a demonstrated track record of building enterprise security companies. He has built a board of advisors that includes the former CTO &amp; CIO of AT&amp;T, former CIO of MetLife, and former CISO at Citigroup, JP Morgan and Merrill Lynch, and the former VP of Sales for Palo Alto Networks. The caliber of the advisors validates the quality and potential of the technology and brings significant firepower to the sales effort with their combined network across key target industries for cybersecurity demand. OurCrowd is investing in partnership with AITV, a US-based venture fund with significant domain expertise in enterprise IT.   	Rapidly growing, multi-billion dollar market: Recent cyberattacks at Target, Home Depot, Adobe, JP Morgan and Sony have cost these brands billions while driving demand for new data security solutions at the CEO and board level. Accordingly, CB Insights cites corporate cybersecurity investments increasing 5 fold from 2009 to 2014. As a security as a service company, Bat Blue exists within the fastest growing segment of the overall cybersecurity industry, expected by Gartner to account for more than $3B of sales in 2015.

"US30000024C0","Earth Accounting"," 	Why We Started This Company   	When consumers have easy access to information about the environmental and social footprint of products they will play an increasingly important role towards achieving a sustainable economy.   	Our Keys To Success   	Recent studies show that 66% of consumers are interested in the sustainability of products they buy. It is also clear that they want transparently presented information on the complete life cycle of products. Earth Accounting's patented smartphone information delivery offers this and more including consumer feedback and product re-direction. This concept has evolved over 6 years and core team members have worked together for the last 4. Our team represents over 40 years experience in the field.   	What Sets Us Apart   	Our emphasis on data transparency, user participation and our complete product life-cycle framework provides Earth Touch app users with a uniquely empowering experience that is unmatched by competing apps.   	The technology to provide such functionality in a smartphone app is not new, but is also not trivial. The key issue for this project, and one of our distinguishing assets, is our strategy for getting the data. To accomplish this continual task we have formed an information cooperative and we have already received several signed letters of intent from prospective members.   	The Data: ACES   	Our ability to collect the vast amount of data necessary for this project and maintaining transparency is what sets us apart from similar product oriented apps. To accomplish this monumental task we have invented and patented a unique process, and formed the first ever data cooperative: ACES - The Alliance for Consumer Empowerment and Sustainability. Similar to a traditional cooperative common among farmers in agriculture, the ACES coop compensates members based on their contribution.   	ACES members will largely be made up of eco label and environmental organizations, manufacturers, and consumers. When a user accesses information on a product, the contributor of that information will be compensated based on a pre-established formula. This reward system incentivizes data contribution and a Wikipedia-like democratic participation system maintains accuracy and transparency by allowing ACES members and end users to challenge existing information.   	The Vision: Earth Touch App   	The first version of the Earth Touch app is to be released by the fall of 2015 and will include data for products in 5 initial categories: packaged foods, household cleaning products, pet food, clothes, and cosmetics. This version will provide the product's approved ecolabels and their definitions, direct users to competing products that better meet personal preferences and allow users to message companies telling them why their product was chosen or not.   	Later versions of the app will include a comprehensive product rating, identifying the social and environmental impact with specific facts that contributed to the product's rating. We will also offer a personalized experience allowing users to prioritize issues of most interest to them. For example, if someone is concerned specifically about child labor, GMOs, and CO2 emissions, we will highlight that product information for them.   	Profile functionality will allow users to track their shopping habits, discover new products, build a shopping list, rate products, and share products, facts, and companies they find interesting. The personalization of Earth Touch greatly improves user experience, increasing participation and app use.   	Income   	Income from the Earth Touch app will be generated from several different sources, the most obvious is in-app advertising and affiliate marketing. As the Earth Accounting product life-cycle database grows we will offer subscription services to manufacturers and organizations interested in both the product information and the consumer spending habits. Another potential revenue stream may include paid download or premium services.

The developer is requesting a loan of $180,000 in order to purchase, renovate, and prepare the property for resale. The developer is purchasing the property for $165,000 and contributing $43,000 as a downpayment. The property is in need of moderate renovations. The estimated construction budget is $50,000.

Specifically geared toward useful invention and innovation as opposed to artistry and design, the funds I'm seeking would be used to make online ad buys and conduct SEO on each of the beta products launched onto Shapeways, and to launch new products faster.  The owner of SelfReliant LLC is not taking compensation, as he is also a stay-at-home dad for his amazing 3-year-old daughter, who wants him to 3D print a Chitty Chitty Bang Bang caras soon as possible for her.  Upon consulting with staff at Shapeways, it was discovered that on average, profitable Shapeways shop owners are investing about $1000 into their products and shops before they start to see a sustainable ROI.

The history of SelfReliant LLC is a bit non-linear so here is the gist:  as a senior at Duke University my LLC was formed and used for activities related to brokering patent purchase agreements in Research Triangle Park.  After some success there, my wife joined me after graduation with a computer science degree, and together we transitioned to the more predictable income of contract web consultants using SelfReliant as our vehicle.  Then we moved to Texas from North Carolina, and SelfReliant was successfully transferred and re-registered here, and it lay dormant while the owner pursued a sales job with an IT company for 3 years.  Upon switching roles with my wife and becoming a stay-at-home dad, it became clear that SelfReliant could once again become an exciting venture, and I invested in the domain www.SelfReliant3D.com, @selfreliant3d on Twitter, and a series of Shapeways prototypes and projects.  Am looking for someone to back me in my quest to churn out an unreasonably high number of new inventions on Shapeways - my business model is ultra-fast time-to-market combined with long-tail marketing of each invention online.","EquityNet","Services","Professional Services","Professional Services, Other","Plano","TX","US","http://www.selfreliant3d.com","http://www.equitynet.com/c/selfreliant-llc-dba-selfreliant-3d","Equity","Closed","2015-02-23 08:07:00","2015-02-23 08:06:59","","10000.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"US10000024DD","Reesio"," 	Reesio is Slack plus Salesforce for the 2.5M residential real estate brokers and agents in the United States. The biggest pain point facing real estate professionals right now is that all of the technologies that exist out there to help them do their jobs are antiquated, fragmented, and clunky. There doesn't exist just ""one system"" that does everything -- CRM, Transaction Management, Marketing, etc. Check out this recent story about a research study conducted with brokerages, highlighting just how big of a problem this is:   	http://www.inman.com/2014/04/11/real-estate-brokerages-crying-out-for-technology-that-integrates/   	Reesio solves for this pain point by providing a beautiful product that combines all of these fragmented products into ONE product, which allows brokers and agents to manage every aspect of their job in one place. Brokers and Agents combine to spend $10B per year on fragmented tools that don't work. It's a huge market.   	We provide full Transaction Management, CRM, Listing Syndication, and Offers Management. Everything is all in one place, with no separate e-signature or other accounts required.   	The product that we've built also has a lot of real estate legalities and compliance features built into it that are tough to replicate. In addition, real estate professionals require a product that is feature-rich to do their job, and it would take at least 2-3 years for another company to build out what we've built to this point. Our deep domain expertise within the real estate industry, coupled with our strong engineering and design skills, allow us to take what is a complex legal process (buying and selling real estate), and turn it into something beautiful and easy to use for the 2.5M real estate brokers and agents in the United States.

"US300000250E","Trident Risk Strategies LLC","Trident is at the pre-revenue stage with a proof of concept to originate, model, underwrite and hedge longevity derivatives on portfolios of life insurance.  Untapped demand for this longevity hedging transaction comes from banks, investment fund managers, and pension administrators.  Banks and insurance companies hold insurance policies and seek to find liquidity in the asset class through a investment grade counter party.  Investment fund managers will purchase life policies and offer the transaction to investors with longevity guarantees at a future date, in comparison to pension administrators who are willing to transfer the longevity exposure by paying premium.  Trident's platform includes proprietary financial models that develop portfolio parameters, simulate portfolio performance probabilities based on graduated mortality distributions, portfolio expenses and rates of return. The cover is secured by a custom insurance contract specific to Trident. 

Trident's business plan includes services for origination structuring, loss probability modeling, medical underwriting with life expectancy, portfolio demographic with performance tracking, and  longevity shortfall  that will be secured by an investment grade insurance issuer. 

Longevity is the risk of life insured living beyond the mortality expectations of a similar group of insured.  Longevity Shortfall is specific to portfolios that have an ending date to calculate investor returns and therefore have  exposure to shortfalls due to longevity.

The funds raised by this offering will be applied to general and administrative expenses, initiate the web interface with strategic partners, corporate identification, up grade and expand the computer platform and  equipment, and retain key personnel in accounting, sales and risk modeling. The funds will not be used to fund the longevity risk.  This is a convertible debt offering with a very attractive rate of return upon liquidation.

Launched September 8th, 2014 at the worlds largest manufacturing and technology show, IMTS (www.imts.com)

In less than 6 months, CNCJobs.net has already  hit the radar of the mega job boards such as Monster, CareerBuilder, and Indeed, due to the immediate growth, but more so because of the video integration. 

All three of the above mentioned boards  have been skirting around the development of Video for the past year, however due there size have put it on the sidelines.

How do we know all this to be fact?  The partners are manufacturing entrepreneurs and understand they do not have the technical abilities to take this site where it needs to go, so they have recruited  the  recent ex VP of Development from Monster who is sitting on the sidelines waiting to come on board. This individual is one of the most highly respected in the industry and is convinced enough in our company that he is simply waiting for an equity position to join us and take over the day to day operations and development.

We are now prepared for that stage and know that we need to seek an investor that can help us take this company to that next level.

The technology is completely  built and the bugs ironed out, CNCJobs is already branded #1 for employment services specific to manufacturing and technology, (the worlds largest industry) , but better yet, we are extremely profitable with 22%+ margins.

We are seeking funding specifically for marketing and SEO improvements.  There are no additional resources needed  for website  development.

"US100000252A","FAB Financial Inc."," 	 Banking is broken. Years ago people who needed business advice would turn to their local bank manager for help. The banker was thought of as a trusted member of the community. Nowadays people don't really like banks. Through consolidation banks have become bigger and bigger, and smaller banks that understood and served their communities have started to disappear. A recent US survey among millennials showed over two-thirds of them would prefer to go to the dentist than hear from their bank and one in three said they are open to switching banks in the next 90 days (source: Scratch Millennial Disruption Survey, 2014). In fact, the four largest banks in the US are among their 10 least-loved brands. It's even worse for artists. Their needs are not being served by banks, which see artists as high-risk and of little monetary value. Yet artists drive the $1.6 trillion creative economy, are the number-one influencers on social media and drive attitudes and purchase decisions of consumer audiences on a massive scale. FAB sees the dissatisfaction with banks as an opportunity to rebuild the traditional banking model and give artists what they need to thrive.   	 Artists everywhere have traditionally been underserved by banks, and have struggled to establish their value in the economy in general, FAB is designed from the ground-up for the creative community with the goal of becoming their trusted business advisor. To resolve these issues, FAB is launching two product offerings: the FAB Money App which will allow artists to understand and manage their money in a simple and engaging way; and FAB Advisory which will help artists make money from their art.

Band & Me unlocks the full potential of direct-to-fan promotion by using a one-to-one connection between the band and each fan that lets bands deliver experiences their fans have never dreamed possible, personal communications like a thank-you text message, an invite to join the band backstage after a gig, or a live video chat. And fans have access to all the band's content from across the web in Band & Me. As they engage and share content they automatically earn points towards special perks like exclusives and recognition events. Fans become part of the band's journey with the chance to rate and review new songs before they're released, and access to behind the scenes action with the band.  Bands using Band & Me to deliver these special experiences are rewarded with accelerated growth in new fans that's measured not in percentages but in multiples, because their fans respond by becoming evangelists raving  about the band to their networks of friends. This generates a continuous buzz that makes fan growth accelerate exponentially faster.    Our target market is not artists in the top 40, it's the 20,000 bands who generate $5 billion in sales each year and who can't afford spending on mass media like radio, print ad and retail displays to grow sales. They've tried to go directly to their fans using Facebook but social media's one-to-many connections prevents their promotions from feeling direct and personal, leaving the viral power of their fans untapped. Band & Me makes direct-to-fan promotion truly effective for the fir time with a one-to-one connection that makes promotion feel personal. We will receive a minority portion of the benefit in higher band income  through subscription fees, affiliate royalties and in-app purchase of digital goods by fans.","EquityNet","Services","Artistic Services","Music Services","Emeryville","CA","US","http://www.equitynet.com/c/bandandme-inc","http://www.equitynet.com/c/bandandme-inc","Convertible Debt","Closed","2015-03-06 00:13:50","2015-03-06 00:13:50","FALSE","500000.0","","","","","","http://www.linkedin.com/in/danwagster","https://www.facebook.com/bandandmeapp","https://twitter.com/bandandme","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The accident threw him off his bike and across an entire lane of highway traffic. Fortunately, he walked away with only a minor concussion and some scrapes and bruises. Inspired by his accident, the life-long rider began researching crash statistics. He quickly discovered that although motorcycles cover less than 0.4% of all miles traveled in the US, motorcyclists account for nearly 15.0% of all road fatalities. On average, at least one motorcyclist dies on American roads every two hours.

This investment opportunity provides a unique combination of a very experienced Internet marketing expert group and the third largest daily fantasy sports wagering platform.  

The daily fantasy sports industry is an explosive phenomenon still in its formative phase.  The top two companies, Fanduel and DraftKings, have raised over $150 million in venture capital in the past six months, with total post money valuations of $700 million.   The investor list is blue chip, including KKR, Shamrock, Raine Group, Redpoint Ventures and NBC.  Nearly all of this new capital has been spent for customer acquisition, with the majority focused on sports television advertising.   The target market of young (30’s) males has been well educated on the availability of this exciting form of gaming.

Daily fantasy sports contests are considered skill based gaming – not gambling – and are legal in 45 of the 50 U. S. states.  Moreover, the professional sports leagues and teams have fully endorsed the fledging business, securing sponsorships and encouraging fan engagement.  Very importantly, fantasy sports are specifically carved out of, and do not apply to, the Federal Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006.  

FanWars LLC has teamed up with DraftDay.com, the number three daily fantasy sports site.  DraftDay was one of the earliest sites and has a very secure and robust technology platform, coupled with a large amount of player activity.  Outside of the top two companies, DraftDay is the only site offering multiple sports and game styles in quantities sufficient to keep player involvement.  This player activity, or liquidity, is measured by funds on deposit, prizes paid and other metrics.  Liquidity is THE criterion separating success from failure.  DraftDay has achieved and maintained its success with excellent customer service, great user interface, and good branding.  However, DraftDay has lacked the investment dollars needed to really grow its user base.

"US3000002578","American Century Life Insurance","American Century is a life insurance company located in Plano, TX that offers life insurance and annuities.

We partnered with a life insurance agency to offer our policies directly to consumers online and allow them to buy the policies directly on the web and without the involvement of an agent.

Currently, we have a special license in Texas that allows us to sell final expense life insurance policies with maximum face amount of $25,000.

Most of the requested capital needed will be used to meet the regulatory requirements to sell larger life policies and expand to additional states.

Small part will be used to fund operations since most of the first year premium is paid as commission to the partner agency.

There is no such offering in the market today and we believe there is a need for such product. Our partner agency has previously worked with an insurance subsidiary of a large bank that offered online purchase of such policies. This insurer sold $70 million of premium in one year. (the bank decided to get out of this non-core business.)

The need to write larger policies and not stay limited to the $25,000 face amount is because most policies will be term policies and only larger policies will drive high enough premium (average of $40/month) to make economical sense.

About American Century

We were  founded in 1940 as a burial association in Texas and converted to an insurance company in 1980.

Raz Silberman, current owner and president, purchased the company in March 2013 from previous owners in Tulsa, OK and brought it back to Texas.  The purchase was funded was Raz’s personal  money and the company has no debt. 

We are financially strong and our  financial ratios meet an A+ rated company standards. However, we do not have the additional capital required to write 

At the time of purchase the company was almost dormant and we have worked in the past two years to add products, agents, and clients.

At the drilling site these house chemicals, fuel cells, generators, and various other pieces of equipment that could possibly leak causing an enviromental hazard.  Currently the drilling companies most often use an expensive plastic liner that is laid down, walls built around using plastic pipe and plastic mats laid inside and finally gravel laid around the outside edge.  This is an expensive  method for containing thier oils and chemicals.   Our solution provides an enviromentally friendly and time saving approach for the operator. Our competitive rental day rates show value to the operator with the time that is saved from loading chemicals onto trucks when moving from pad to pad and no need for a 3-4 man crew to set up the plastic lining they are currently utilizing.

"US100000259D","Q2Power Corp.","Every hour in the United States an estimated 20 million dekatherms of methane is flared and wasted to the atmosphere -- enough energy to heat over 6 million homes for an entire month. This fuel is being wasted because there has historically been no other cost effective alternative to using the low quality “dirty” gas produced at landfills, waste water treatment facilities and many oil / gas wellheads.     

Q2 Power (“Q2P” or the “Company”) is a renewable power company that utilizes proprietary technology and proven business models to monetize waste energy resources such as methane. Q2P is poised to capture a significant portion of this untapped market due to three key factors: 

•	We believe that our proprietary, patented technology is ideally suited for use with this fuel source. Our power systems are small, scalable and modular, and can be installed at the site of methane flares at a similar cost per kW as large-scale power plants. 

•	Our business model employs Power Purchase Agreements (PPA), which eliminate financial risks for our customers and reduce sales cycles. Unlike solar installations which are effective at most 6.5 hours per day, Q2P’s systems can generate power 24 hours a day, thus creating a far more attractive return on investment.   

•	Federal and local environmental crackdowns on methane emissions are creating urgency to install systems that can cost-effectively convert this wasted fuel source to usable power.   

With the methane that is wasted each year in the U.S., Q2P could generate over 9,100 Gigawatt hours of electrical power, representing a $900 Million annual total addressable market. At a 5% U.S. market penetration, Q2P could generate in excess of $45 Million per year, or $320 Million over a 7-year PPA term, with greater than a 40% unlevered, unsubsidized IRR.  Further, we estimate that the international markets are potentially 10 to 20 times larger than in the U.S.

"US30000025A4","Viachat Inc."," 	Why we started ViaChat   	Customers are on mobile and overwhelmingly using messaging for personal communications, but cannot connect to businesses. We believe that text messaging is the preferred interface for simpler transactions but app-type graphical user interfaces are required for most business interactions. Each small business cannot have its app or require consumers to have them. Smaller businesses are increasing offering eCommerce, a $100B market that is growing at 30%, but these are web-oriented, not mobile focused. The related on-demand mobile services market (ordered from mobile but fulfilled offline) is impacting broad categories of the service economy (business services, transportation, food &amp; dining, care services, health &amp; beauty, delivery, events, travel), each solution requires users to discover and download their specific app. Although million plus apps exist on stores, typically less than 5-7 apps are actively used. Users prefer the app UI, but app discovery model is broken.   	These are some fundamental disconnects between consumer mobile experience and access to business commerce and services that ViaChat is trying to address.   	What sets us apart?   	ViaChat upgrades mobile messaging to a business commerce/services platform that can push custom apps to users providing ease of access and the elegance of graphical UX. ViaChat platform aggregates on-demand businesses to provide discovery, information, ordering, payment, fulfillment (off-line) and confirmation; in short it automates the service economy by enabling commerce and business services through applets over mobile messaging.

"US30000025A4","Viachat Inc."," 	Why we started ViaChat   	Customers are on mobile and overwhelmingly using messaging for personal communications, but cannot connect to businesses. We believe that text messaging is the preferred interface for simpler transactions but app-type graphical user interfaces are required for most business interactions. Each small business cannot have its app or require consumers to have them. Smaller businesses are increasing offering eCommerce, a $100B market that is growing at 30%, but these are web-oriented, not mobile focused. The related on-demand mobile services market (ordered from mobile but fulfilled offline) is impacting broad categories of the service economy (business services, transportation, food &amp; dining, care services, health &amp; beauty, delivery, events, travel), each solution requires users to discover and download their specific app. Although million plus apps exist on stores, typically less than 5-7 apps are actively used. Users prefer the app UI, but app discovery model is broken.   	These are some fundamental disconnects between consumer mobile experience and access to business commerce and services that ViaChat is trying to address.   	What sets us apart?   	ViaChat upgrades mobile messaging to a business commerce/services platform that can push custom apps to users providing ease of access and the elegance of graphical UX. ViaChat platform aggregates on-demand businesses to provide discovery, information, ordering, payment, fulfillment (off-line) and confirmation; in short it automates the service economy by enabling commerce and business services through applets over mobile messaging. We believe this is disruptive and transformational and will change forever how we get services from business.   	What is the our key to success?   	Viral growth with enterprise monetization model:   	Free mobile messaging for smaller business to connect to the millions that are already messaging   	Free custom apps that can automate commerce and service delivery while providing elegant user experience   	Let's business easily host products, services and offers with location based discovery   	Solutions customized for vertical markets -- food tech, education, community, customer service, etc   	Starting with pay for use – transaction fees charged only when the business gets value.

The Company’s primary purpose is providing operating capital, directly or indirectly, to one or more companies engaged in the business of pre-qualifying potential plaintiffs in mass tort personal injury cases.  In contrast to the “typical” litigation funding scenario, a few funding companies have begun to focus on funding cases arising out of large-scale claims involving personal injuries attributable to defective medical products or pharmaceuticals - otherwise known as “mass tort"" claims. Mass torts are considered to provide a cost-effective alternative to lengthy and expensive traditional single-party litigation. These cases usually involve large corporate defendants, such as pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers, that have already been found liable (or have conceded liability) with respect to a defective or harmful product. In most of such cases, the defendant establishes a settlement fund, to be administered by the court, and from which qualified claimants will be paid. In such cases, a plaintiff generally only needs to show (i) that his/her damages were caused by the defective product, and (ii) the extent of such damages.  When a prospective plaintiff is identified, the plaintiff undergoes a thorough screening (that can include interviews, detailed reviews of medical records, an independent medical examination and, if necessary, revisionary surgery) to determine that such plaintiff has a valid and viable claim for recovery. Once a plaintiff is qualified, he/she is referred to an experienced attorney who files a case, negotiates a settlement and obtains a financial recovery.   	•The mass tort process dates back to the 1960’s (not a new concept) •There exists NO market or traditional sector correlation or interest rate risk for this investment •This is not Litigation Funding.  We DO NOT provide funding to Law Firms or Plaintiffs.

"US10000025DE","Pinnacle Enterprise Business Systems","Pinnacle Enterprise Business Solutions is an IT contracting firm established to provide purpose-built technical solutions to public- and private-sector organizations through customer-focused collaborations and investments in our nation’s Veterans. In December 2013, Pinnacle received certification as a verified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB). Pinnacle is a Limited Liability Corporation with two business units, IT consulting & engineering services, and vocational rehabilitation services for veterans. IT consulting & engineering services will pursue federal government contract set-s-sides for small businesses and SDVOSBs. Vocational rehabilitation services help Veterans transition back into civilian life and join the private-sector workforce. 
Despite the political gridlock in Washington over government spending, funding for the VA has grown in 2015, by nearly 68% from 2009. The politicians understand our nation has a solemn obligation to take care of our Veterans and to honor them for their service and sacrifices on behalf of the United States. To deliver on this commitment, the Federal budget provides $65.3 billion in discretionary funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), a 3-percent increase above the 2014 enacted level.   
Pinnacle is poised for success because it will take advantage of current atmosphere in Washington, policies, and initiatives to enter in to the federal contracting business to capitalize on the abundant opportunities set-a-side for SDVOSB.

Twitch, a recent 1B USD Amazon acquisition delivers only 2-D live games to mobile and web browsers and is vastly successful - The latest Twitch metrics prove the success of social live gaming: >55 million unique viewers per month, >1 million unique broadcasts per month., >6,400 Broadcasting partners producing content , >13 billion minutes watched per month, >106 Minutes watched per person per day, >12 million Installations of the Twitch iOS/Android app 

We now expand the proven Twitch experience literally to a new dimension:  

 #PLAY - plays games everywhere - in 2-D and 3-D on any device - wherever you are.


What is  #PLAY ?

#PLAY is a software-platform, consisting of several closely interacting core components making up the #PLAY Universe.
- a cloud based, highly scalable server and database architecture. 
- an app for iOS and Android mobile devices.
- an app for Virtual Reality devices, such as the Oculus Rift  or Samsung Gear VR or HTC Vive
- an app for leading 2-D and 3D- Smart TV’s from Samsung, LG, Panasonic and others.

We believe, through the unique experience and larger scope, after just a few years, #PLAY will be able to generate metrics, far exceeding those of Twitch.


What makes #PLAY unique?
Through three innovative technologies, #PLAY protects its unique experience from being copied by Twitch or other market players:
Its concept of live 3-D game streaming is filed for patent.

Two more patents will be filed by #PLAY in March:
a groundbreaking, intuitive 3-D user interface.
a unique and innovative multi-screen mechanics.

More patentable technology for next-gen gaming is being developed and will be filed throughout the next months.

=> #PLAY is the primary and fun-to-use-platform to deliver high quality 2-D and 3-D stereoscopic live and on-demand gaming to consumers everywhere.
=> #PLAY is the only platform syndicating content from several sources and pushing it out to several platforms for second exploit","EquityNet","Services","New Media","Digital Media/New Media","wilmington","DE","US","http://www.hashplay.tv","http://www.equitynet.com/c/hashplay-inc734","Convertible Debt","Closed","2015-03-22 11:14:59","2015-03-22 11:14:59","","750000.0","","","","","","http://www.linkedin.com/company/9237905","http://www.facebook.com/hashplayinc ","http://twitter.com/hashplayinc","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"US1000002603","Kraqkel","Hi my name is Rudie Young and I’m here at Equitynet.com seeking to raise $1,000,000 in equity option in order to launch a brand new fast casual dining restaurant called Kraqkel. Rather than starting a new restaurant from scratch. I plan to acquire and operate several small sized restaurants from 1400 sq ft to 2600 sq ft “small is more” around the greater Los Angeles County. These restaurants are for sale for various reasons such as retirement, relocation, health, dissolving partnership and etc. I plan to only purchase independently owned profitable restaurants. The obvious is there’s already a steady stream of revenue, an existing customer base and vendor relationships, established brand, proven concept, community relationship, and more importantly there are already trained employees in place. This will enable me to focus on implementing growth strategies and improve upon the quality of service and menu offering by slowly introducing some of Kraqkel’s delicious fares. Kraqkel will feature a wide selection of fresh juicy hamburgers, custom sandwiches, and salads as well as fresh delicious pastas. For the most part we will be updating the interior decor of any restaurant that we acquire to meet what Kraqkel must look like. I have no plans on acquiring any franchise restaurants due to franchisors fees, royalty fees from the gross sales, advertising/marketing fees, and etc.

The $1,000,000 capitalization is to acquire several existing “profitable” restaurants within the next twelve to eighteen months.

As I plan to grow and expand Kraqkel throughout Los Angeles and Orange County. I know Kraqkel will be a true crowdfunding success story with an exit strategy of being acquired or going public in the next ten years or sooner. Minimum investment of $1000 is required.

I will be happy to answer any questions you may have and discuss the opportunity in greater details. You can email me at brcd90503@yahoo.com with Equitynet / Kraqkel on the Subject line.

"US1000002636","Rowheels, Inc.","Rowheels has entered the durable medical equipment market with a revolutionary propulsion system for manual wheelchairs, initially penetrating the advanced rehab end of the $4 Billion personal mobility market.  The patented design (USP 8,931,796) offers an enhanced, biomechanically efficient pull-based propulsion method that helps mitigate repetitive stress injuries, while correcting posture and spine position.  Patients and providers have long sought a product that extends the lifetime use of manual wheelchairs, thereby allowing for daily physical activity and a reduction in the incidence of various hypokinetic disorders. The initial Rowheels design has been reviewed by a significant cross section of the industry including Georgia Tech’s CATEA and RERC Labs, who concluded “the device is unique and possesses the potential of true innovation.

Rowheels have been engineered for higher performance, day to day use.  They are easier to transport and maneuver than competitive products and have a similar weight and profile to that of a conventional wheel, something highly desired by users.  Rowheels Rev1 wheels are a retrofit to existing wheelchair frames and are being marketed and sold as a replacement wheelset.

Sales were initiated in April 2015, after three years of extensive engineering, testing and tooling. Distribution is being established through providers, OEM partnerships, distributors and direct sales.  Relationships with strategic partners, physical therapists and industry manufacturers will be a key to driving business growth.  The aging population and the desire for higher quality medical products will drive long term growth opportunities. The Company is actively exploring an expanded corporate strategy that drives costs down and greatly expands overall market potential.  The high end Rev1 wheels are coded in the United States under HCCPS Code E2227 for medical necessity and are classified as a Class 1 Medical device by the FDA.

Galenus’s team is focused on providing remote healthcare, also known as Telehealth.   	  The world of healthcare has been changing for over a decade in ways that moves the healthcare consumer closer to a direct relationship with personal health care providers and health care teams.

When contamination is found the system dispatches technicians to inspect and then remove contaminants, leaving the fuel clean and ready to use.  On leaving the facility, the process provides the retailer, or tank owner, with video validation that contamination does not exist in the tank. The company offers retailer driven advertising and operational management from the gathered  monitoring data. The income generated for GreenFuelsUSA come from monthly and service related fees.  There are 127,000 retail fuel outlets and over 1,000,000 more tanks of other categories in North American alone and the market for these services is very large and unserved at this time.  The company will deploy technicians and service equipment from regional hubs starting in Texas, Oklahoma and surrounding states.  The process is a GREEN company due to the fact that clean fuel emits less than 35% of the CO2 into our air than common unclean fuels do.  There are some tax advantages to investment in GreenFuelsUSA as well as  projected income from stock or convertible ownership over time.  The entire technology package from GreenFuelsUSA is a major change in fuel station management and recording / security management of that station or stations.

The principals at TFP have been a powerful force in real estate for years. We've achieved success by adhering to a core group of principles: diversifying holdings to weather fickle financial trends and climates; keeping debt low in order to ensure capital is always working for us and our clients; and providing extensive expertise to manage and operate our own properties. These qualities combine to ensure TFP's success.   	In an age of ever-more questionable decisions and rapid-fire investment deals, it's encouraging to find a real estate company whose success is a direct result of rock-solid core principles and proven management philosophies. This is stability.   	Some may call it a magic touch. But TFE has anticipated variable market trends, and strategically acquired targeted properties to profit from them. This nearly uncanny ability to readily adapt to an ever-changing real estate market is the key element that separates us from other investment firms – we provide growth and profitability, regardless of what is happening in the market. In truth, magic has little to do with it; our success stems from a very down-to-earth combination of insight and acumen... of diligence and expertise... and of hard work.

"US2000002672","StorMaxx Self Storage Project"," 	The StorMaxx Self Storage Project (“Project”) will purchase a property in Cleburne, Texas that was previously used as a nursing home and convert the building into a climate-controlled self storage business.  The total Project investment is estimated to be $355,000, comprising a $120,000 property purchase price  and $235,000 for repairs and improvements.   	The Project will be 100% debt funded and  all loans will be at a 6% annual interest rate with payments made monthly.  The Project loan structure will provide for interest-only payments to investors for the first 2 years, in order to minimize costs while the business increases its occupancy rate.  For years 3 through 22 of the loan, investors will receive principle and interest payments based on a 20-year amortized loan structure.   	The financial summary assumes that units will be rented at a rate of 4 units per month until an occupancy rate of 85% is achieved.  The Project is forecasted to generate a pre-tax loss of ~$40,000 in the first year of operation.  This loss will be funded by the Project Sponsors.  The Project is forecasted to reach a positive cash flow status in year 2, and reach 85% occupancy early in year 3.  Once the Project reaches 85% occupancy it will generate annual pre-tax profits of ~$36,000 and have a debt coverage ratio of 2.1.   	Cleburne is a growing suburb of the Dallas/Ft. Worth metroplex with a current population of ~30,000.  Substantial  growth is expected in the near future due to the new Chisholm Trail toll road that opened in 2014, which connects Cleburne with Ft. Worth.  Development is already occurring along the toll road corridor and new housing subdivisions are planned in the Cleburne area.  This should translate into a need for more self storage services in the area.  And, as most of the existing self-storage businesses have only a small percentage of climate-controlled units, the Project’s offering of 100% climate-controlled units should be attractive to the self-storage consumer.

"US1000002677","Effluent Free Desalination Corporation a/k/a EFD Corp."," 	 Lack of adequate clean water for drinking and agriculture is one of the most important challenges facing the world today. This growing crisis is fueled by drought, pollution and population growth. Effluent Free Desalination Corp (EFD) has the patented solution to the problem.   	 While there is plenty of water, most of it is salty seawater. Even in inland areas, the water is often unusable due to salt or pollution. The main technology used today for desalination, known as Reverse Osmosis (RO), produces the unfortunate by-product of toxic concentrated brine. In coastal areas, where existing desalination facilities are dumping concentrated brine back in the ocean, there are major public and regulatory objections to the RO technology. In inland areas, there is no environmentally acceptable way to dispose of the toxic brine.   	 EFD has a unique patented solution which produces no brine and eliminates major environmental objections. EFD's technology is the combination of two well-known and well-understood technologies. It produces distilled water and dry salt. The process is effective for both high volume production of fresh water and for the cleansing of dirty water from agricultural runoff and industrial waste.   	 It can even eliminate the concentrated toxic brine from existing desalination plants. The sale of both the water and the salt makes EFD's technology much more profitable than other desalination methods.   	 The combination of the worldwide need for clean water and EFD's patented technology creates an enormous opportunity to make a difference in the world environmentally and to make a substantial return on investment for investors.   	 We have corporate headquarters and a manufacturing facility near Sacramento, California, where we are building a mobile demonstration machine. We plan to complete the machine in late 2015 and hold a major launch event in early 2016. We will manufacture mobile machines with capacities of 30,000 to 300,000 gallons per day and will license our technology to large contractors to build fixed site and utility scale plants around the world.   	 EFD's patent was issued in 2013 US 8496787 B2.

"US100000267A","Functional Family Medicine","Functional Family Medicine is the only Direct Primary Care medical practice in Albuquerque, NM. Direct Primary Care practices are opening their doors all across the country. DPC is primary health care with insurance removed from the equation. We do not take insurance. We have a membership based business model in which our members pay a low monthly fee. They receive same and next day appointments, on time visits and unhurried time with their provider. We have no co-pays, no-deductiables, no insurance headaches at all. 

In our model the provider is free to deliver real personalized care to our members. An insurance company is not making the decisions about our member's health care. Those decisions are between the patient and the provider, like they should be. Our members receive unlimited visits and around the clock access to their provider. We make house calls, at no additional cost, if our members are too sick to come to the office. One of our medical staff will over see a member's care if they should need to be hospitalized, in person. The level of care we provide is unparalleled.

The average wait time national to see a primary care provider is nineteen days with an average of office visit of eight to twelve minutes. That is not health care. That is sickness management, at best! We are all acutely aware of the heath care crisis facing our country. Their is a huge shortfall of primary care providers and that shortage is increasing daily. There are less and less providers and more and more people in need of and gaining access to health care insurance. The health care bases primary care insurance model is broken. That reality has caused a huge oppertunity for  Direct Primary Care practices. 

The margins in the Direct Primary Practice model are unbelievable. The market is literally untouched the growth potential and market stability are unquestionable. There is good reason that the Direct Primary Care model is the fastest growing form of primary care in America.

On our catering side, we have signed up with three companies and also do private catering, and we will do anything the client needs, with or without the truck. We do weddings, corporate events, festivals and we are often booked daily for doubles on the food truck with a corporate drop off catering on the side. The business has grown so fast and I have been working to pay off the food truck and now it is PIF but in the meantime I took equity loans on the business. I am working on getting an SBA loan now that I own the foodtruck, but in the meantime would love to be able to fund the personal and COG required to continue the growth. The SBA loan would pay off any other loans that I have and my SBA lenders are extremely positive, it's just a timely process. Whatever I might get from EquityNet would go to pay off loans as well and feed the operating capital until the SBA loan comes in. At this point our growth has been (100% in the last two months). I am a biochemist with an MBA and I love to cook, published in Sunset Magazine, and have a full time software sales position. Our food truck ROCKS!!

OurCrowd first invested in Stringify in October 2014 and now has the opportunity to join a round being led by San Francisco based venture capital firm, Artis Ventures.   	 Stringify is led by three co-founders with vast product and technology backgrounds who together have dozens of patents and product awards across numerous industries. CEO Mike Yurochko is a user experience (""UX"") and product marketing expert who ran one of the largest suites of digital financial user experiences in the world while at JPMorganChase, and is responsible for much of the world's first groundbreaking smartphone product designs from his time at Handspring and Palm. CTO Dave Evans left his role as Chief Futurist at Cisco to join Stringify as a founder, garnering attention from the tech community due to Dave's prominent stature in the industry (see this news story about his arrival). Dave was hired 24 years ago as the first ever IT engineer at Cisco, where he eventually became the company's Chief Futurist and was also the CTO of the Internet Business Solutions Innovations Practice. Chief Creative Officer Yaron Sheba worked with Mike at JPMC and was previously the Creative Director and Head of Design at SanDisk. Sheba’s portfolio has reached 100s of millions of customers and spans much of JPMorgan Chase’s digital properties, many of the world’s first USB drives and numerous mp3 players. The company's advisors include Ed Colligan and Eli Harari, the former CEOs of Palm and SanDisk, respectively.   	Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging conceptual framework in which everyday objects (like consumer electronics, appliances, buildings and transportation) have network connectivity, allowing them to send and receive data. There are already 10 billion connected things today and the market is expected to grow to anywhere between 50 and 200 billion connected things over the next 10 years, equating to over $8T in revenue per year according to IDC. Major companies are investing heavily in the future of IoT with recent acquisitions and announcements, including Google's acquisitions of Nest ($3.2B) and Dropcam ($555M), Apple's announcement of its Healthkit and Homekit developer programs, and appliance giants GE and LG launching new IoT product lines like smart ovens.    	Stringify's technology enables individuals with no technical background to dictate how their smart devices can work together, to provide a unified living experience (e.g. “When I close the door to my bedroom after 8pm, dim the lights to 5%, lower the thermometer and switch on calming music”). Individuals can leverage Stringify's design studio to create these ""flows"", or can discover smart devices and flows developed by other users on Stringify's marketplace.

The venue is situated a block away from the new World Trade Center and directly next to Fulton Center, the third largest transit hub in New York City.   	Having closed the previous offering for US $38 million, used for the acquisition and pre-development of the Property, Prodigy Network presents the first of three offerings, each for US$10 million. The equity raised, together with construction financing, will be used to renovate the current 126,710 sq ft structure and to build a 49,335 sq ft glass tower above the existing building.   	 Assemblage/Financial District will generate 4 main revenue streams for the investors, (1) collaborative workspace memberships and related operations, (2) short-term apartments, (3) food and beverage operations, and (4) rent of space for private events.   	In this location, we anticipate that the collaborative workspace will have approximately 400 members on an annual basis, for an average monthly membership of US $1,000.   	For the short term apartments component, we estimate a conservative 85% occupancy rate, based on New York City’s average occupancy rate of 88% in 2013, according to the official statistics of New York City. It is expected that the apartments will rent for an average daily rate of approximately US $375, an attractive price point compared to similar sized rooms at the various luxury hotels in Manhattan.   	 The property will be home to Assemblage, a community of top creators, innovators, artists, scientists, and entrepreneurs, looking to connect and build relationships to achieve inspiring goals that will change the world.   	We envisioned innovative leaders inhabiting the working and living space of Assemblage— a space where the collaborative nature of our guests will be engaged. Imagine, the cross pollination between individuals from different fields, enabling unique opportunities that breeds positive change through innovation and collaboration.   	The spirit of creativity and collaboration has been present since the inception of Assemblage, the first crowd-designed project in New York, if not in the world. This was the result of a crowdsourcing competitionthat we launched through Prodigy Design Lab.   	Beyond the walls of our guests work/personal life, they will come to Assemblage to connect and curate pioneering ideas. The community will be inspired by the Ubuntu philosophy: “I Am Because You Are”. Assemblage is built with the intention to nurture great minds, to foster creative energy that will inspire change for those who inhabit the space.   	 We anticipate selling the 185 short-term apartments as individual condos for an estimated US $1.25 million in average.   	Concurrently with the sale of the residences, we plan on selling the collaborative workspace and restaurant to a single institutional buyer. It is anticipated that the commercial condo, which includes the cellar, first, second, and third floor, will sell for approximately US $40 million.

"US10000026FF","P2P Cash"," 	Value Proposition: P2P Cash is the ONLY money transfer company offering FREE Global Money Transfer. With MasterCard, P2P guarantees secure money transfer to 1.2+ billion cellphones globally at no cost to the consumer. P2P's patent-pending Instant Money Tokens (IMTs) deposit cash directly into bank and mobile accounts in real-time.   	P2P Cash monetizes this free service, buying foreign currency at interbank rates and delivering at retail rates, grossing ~1.5% on each transaction.   	Financial: P2P's free cash transfer model generates significant cash flows. P2P revenue derives from the foreign exchange (FX) differential between retail and wholesale FX rates (+2% to +5%). Through close FX margin management and extensive cost controls, P2P Cash expects to generate $23M of high-margin revenue by the end of 2017 reaching .   	Market: The global remittance market will reach about $600 billion this year with more than $50 billion in transfer fee revenues. The U.S. is the largest outbound remittance corridor and the top few recipient markets account for &gt;50% of the dollar volume: China, India, Mexico, Philippines, Vietnam and Africa.   	Problem: Banks and money transfer corporations have gouged consumers long enough. P2P Cash uses patent-pending technology to deliver cash to families back home. Current service offerings are slow and expensive for consumers, and difficult to deliver to recipients in developing countries, particularly in rural areas. Due to poor industry infrastructure and legacy systems, market players cannot effectively serve clients. Therefore consumers, who need these services most and can afford it least, end up paying the highest costs.   	Solution: P2P Cash significantly reduces clearing costs and time frames, creating a highly efficient and scalable freemium business model. Our encrypted IMT technology delivers remittances safely and directly to the recipient's cellphone and/or bank account instantly.   	Using SWIFT and emerging mobile wallet standards, P2P Cash customers can send cash to over 1.2+ Billion cellphones worldwide without charging transaction fees. Key strategic partner MasterCard expands our international reach into 60+ countries. The P2P Cash solution meets all US regulatory standards and exceeds international payment security standards.

"US1000002704","Phoenix Financial Holdings, Inc."," 	Phoenix Financial Holdings Inc. is a conglomerate holdings firm that oversees and manages subsidiary business entities. The firm's current investment activities involve investments into middle-market business entities and acquisition of small to mid-sized C-Corporation companies who have demonstrated growth potential. Through leadership and strategic planning, Phoenix Financial Holdings Inc. seeks to optimize its subsidiaries corporate structures for maximum returns, and by the virtue of scope of operations throughout the firm's holdings portfolio, increase overall corporate value for the firm and its venture partners. The firm excels in generating value while mitigating risk through diversification in both its target holdings portfolio composition as well as diversification in the firm's revenue structure through LBO majority ownership and operations acquisitions, combined with minority equity investments into high performing, well structured, established brands.   	There are numerous companies that have established local brand presences, strong historical ties to the communities they serve, and have significant growth potential; however many lack the sophistication, structure, or resources necessary to elevate these brands from their apparent ""mom &amp; pop"" classifications to compete amongst the larger corporate entities that often enter markets and erode local share. Our firm buys into these middle-market companies and infuses operational resources to make those brands more productive than they are currently. We aim to optimize the structure of these companies, to ensure the operations are sustained, and are able to continue having positive implications on the communities they serve. Our goal is to position acquired middle-market companies for growth and expansion; not flipping businesses like many of our competitors. Our firm is interested in an aggressive proliferation of our holdings portfolio. We are focused on 6 high performing and competitive sectors which go towards maintaining diversification within our holdings and mitigating risk.   	Phoenix Financial Holdings expects to see 40% growth year-to-year. Phoenix Financial is able to aggressively increase the firm's value in more compressed time frames by virtue of our LBO structured acquisitions of companies whose gross revenues are minimally $1.5MM annually.   	The firm currently has a solid funnel of working LBO transactions ready for financing and capital investments to stimulate the stated growth. Additionally, the firm is able to further supplement and increase the firm's value through a steady 10% increase year-to-year in minority equity investments into established entities that have proven operational structures and management. Through these types of auxiliary revenue streams, the firm can further support potential capital investments into subsidiaries and newly acquired firms without constraining the firm's management &amp; operations, ensuring value is created and returns to investors are maintained.

With the introduction of the FMCSA Electronic Logging Device regulations scheduled for Q4/2015 this market will be expanded to 4.3 million trucks. 65% of those trucks will belong to fleets of 5 trucks and under.

This strategy will bring more value to the small fleets and owner-operators than our competition, and will allow us to convey a clear value message.   	To this end we have acquired Sable Express EOBR platform from Sable Truck Systems. With additional investment we will add a full suite of communications and business automation capabilities.

"US300000275A","Somadome"," 	Stress and anxiety are preventable factors, which is why the corporate wellness industry is projected to grow 9.4% annually to $3.4 billion by 2018 and ""wellness"" is predicted to become ""the next trillion-dollar industry."" Interest in managing stress and anxiety has spawned the ""Mindfulness Movement,"" which is being led by major health care providers, corporate employers and wellness centers and luxury spas. But, despite this interest, most consumers don't know how to integrate any efficient solutions into their daily lives.   	Somadome, Inc. has introduced the first commercial ""product"" that can offer an affordable, accessible, packaged solution to access mindfulness and manage stress conveniently and effectively, in 20 minutes.  	 	The Company's product—the Somadome—is a freestanding microenvironment that provides a private space for people to relax and benefit from three therapeutic treatments that work synergistically to enable whole person wellness.   	The Company has developed and tested four iterations of its Somadome in numerous environments to confirm the product's effectiveness, and has taken steps to protect its expanding intellectual property portfolio. The Company has also seen considerable unsolicited, enthusiastic interest from consumers, prospective commercial partners and from the emerging ""wellness"" industry.   	Now, after over four years of self-funded development, the Somadome was launched at 5-Diamond luxury wellness spa Ojai Inn and Resort in April 2015 and in May in NYC's #1 rated luxury spa, the Cornelia in The Surrey Hotel. There are 22,000 such luxury spas in the United States, which account for about $84 billion in revenue annually. Globally, the ""wellness economy"" is a $3.4 trillion industry with 110,000 spas.   	During the next three years, Somadome plans to install about 150 pods in commercial (50) and corporate environments (150) primarily in leading luxury wellness resorts as well as wellness-focused corporations. Notably, the Company was recently 'activated' by Richard Branson at his Virgin Disruptor's event in SF, and is now in negotiations to partner with Virgin for placements in their various verticals.

Inbound Shift recently reduced a national event company’s digital marketing budget from $200k to $50k per month with 25% increased sales through its inbound marketing  solution. Inbound Shift clients get access to a dashboard that tracks their ROI for their marketing spend.  This is the first turnkey solution to both create and track ROMI (return on marketing investment) for digital marketing budgets in a real time format.  

Playing Offense When It Comes to Technology Disruption - Application development is arguably the biggest disruptor for companies today.  If you don’t believe that, you might want to ask Blockbuster (Netflix), Borders (Amazon), or Taxi’s (Uber) how application development affected their industries?  Inbound Shift has recently designed mobile application solutions that will allow a 25 million member health care group and a 75 year old film distribution company become the hunters instead of the hunted in their industries.  It will become a growing need for both private and public organizations to innovate when it comes to application development over the next few decades.  We will be their partner to deploy powerful mobile applications in a timely fashion.  As a partner in the apps with the clients, we retain the IP as well as revenue share and advertising revenues.

"US1000002776","Fresh Food Paradise Corp","It´s time for a fresh breeze in the food market  	 So-called Delivered Do-It-Yourself Meal Kits are currently the new trend. The concept behind it is very simple and therefore very easy to copy. Potential customers see virtually no difference between these providers at all. „Blue Apron"" and „Hello Fresh"", two major players offer virtually identical products to their customers, while ultimately being mere imitations of the original business idea which came from Sweden. Smaller companies follow the same concept, but deliver only locally. Nevertheless, this concept is still being copied and other vendors are pushing into this market and are trying to take advantage of this trend.   	 The Fresh Food Paradise Corporation was established to offer a new alternative to these custmers. Our approach differs completely from anything else in the market.   	 We intend to be the only company on the market, specialized in completely prepared vegan meals that are sold immediately after preparation either through shops or are sent directly to the consumer. By fully prepared we mean that all ingredients are washed, trimmed, cut to size, portioned and delivered. All that is needed now is a stove, a pan and a pot; not even a knife will be required. Our products are ready-made meals that contain everything that is needed, but are NOT pre-cooked or frozen. The vegetables are portioned and packed into a protective environment, together with all the other required ingredients.   	 We will be the only company that offers freshly prepared dishes for single-person households. With Blue Apron or Hello Fresh you must order certain minimum quantities (eg. 3 meals for 2 = 6 meals) - not really versitile for singles, considering that you must know how to cook and that you need much more time to prepared and much more differents.   	 The preparation of our products is as simple and as fast as conventional ready-made meals. Our meals contain only fresh and healthy ingredients and taste exactly like it was prepared from scratch by the customers themselves.   	 Ideally, less than 24 hours lie between preparing the meal by us and final preparation by our customers. In order to be able to ensure this, we will need to build manufacturing sites throughout the United States which can cater to a 200 to 250 miles radius.   	 We intend to ship and sell six days per week and we will ensure that our own shops have at least 30 different meals and recipes to choose from. We will continuously expand this selection.   	 As mentioned, we intend to set up our own shops in all major cities, where fresh produce from our production sites can be purchased by anyone walking into our stores. This is unique and has not been available on the market until now. We will offer a large variety of a healthy and freshly produced goods through our stores, and open a completely new healthy food market. A world premiere, which could change the entire market.   	 That is our short business concept; watch the video to see the concept in 3 minutes, and will see why we need a lot of capital before we can deliver the first meal.  The market is waiting for our idea  	 Blue Apron amd Hello Fresh is is growing rapidly, in autumn 2014, Blue Apron delivered 1 million meals per month, currently they are already at 3 million per month.   	 Our concept allows the customer to be much more flexible in terms of ordering, and the goods are always fresh. Additionally, our recipes are chosen strictly according to health regulations.

Our borrower has a huge competitive advantage that we allow him the ability to offer cash and a quick close. These properties are a buy-and-hold, long-term investment.

When making what is likely the biggest purchase of their lives, homebuyers are challenged to make the right decisions and know what actions to take at each step of the way, from pre-contract to closing. Amitree has developed a platform that generates a contextual understanding of each home buyer’s needs, guiding them through the entire administrative process and notifying them of required documents and critical service purchases as they progress toward closing. Moreover, the system allows real estate agents to create curated experiences for their clients and monitor their progress remotely while greatly reducing the points of friction in the agent-client workflow. The platform is powered by an abstract rule engine that is built on hundreds of hours of research conducted with real estate attorneys and agents.   	Positioned at the center of a huge market with numerous monetization channels: Amitree’s placement in the flow of the transaction makes it a platform for purchasing all of the services needed in the home buying process outside of the actual home itself. These can include lending, insurance, appraisals, inspections, title and escrow, security, cable and utilities, movers, and attorneys, among others. Amitree’s monetization strategy is to notify the homebuyer of the next item on their checklist and offer to sell them the right service at the right time. Given the immense value that Amitree provides to agents, agents onboard clients to the platform at no cost to Amitree, creating significant leverage in the model. Thousands of active buyers have already been invited to the platform by agents and the feedback we received from the customers we spoke with was overwhelmingly positive.   	Founding team with prior exit: The five members of the Amitree founding team previously worked together at Dapper, an Israeli startup that specialized in programmatic ad buying that was co-founded by Jonathan Aizen. In 2010 Yahoo acquired the company for $55M, and four of the five went on to spend the next two years at Yahoo building adtech solutions. In 2012, Jonathan was bothered by the lack of technology involved in his own home buying process, and came up with the idea for Amitree. He then reached out to his former team and the group reunited to establish the company.   	Top global VC increasing its stake: Amitree is backed by Accel Partners, one of the most reputable and accomplished venture capital firms in the world. Best known for its investment in Facebook, Accel has seen 23 of its investments IPO and 111 be acquired; notable and recent exits include Kayak, QlikTech, RenRen, ComScore, SquareSpace, Groupon, Arista Networks and Etsy. Accel has experience with the real estate tech industry as early investors in Trulia, acquired by Zillow for $2.5B.  Having invested in Jonathan’s previous company, Dapper, Accel’s Bruce Golden bet on Jonathan once again with Amitree and is increasing the firm’s stake in the current investment round. Other current investors who are joining the round are Yahoo founder / former CEO Jerry Yang and multiple former senior Yahoo execs. Rob Chandra, formerly at Bessemer Ventures, and Owen Van Natta, former COO of Facebook, are also investors in the company.

We will act on this belief by offering a full-service kitchen, top-rated beers, and entertainment that will keep patrons in their seats, ordering more products.   	Once the brand is established, KBC intends on creating a full line of beer and using existing distribution relationships in Wisconsin and other states to expand its footprint.   	Potential Long-Term options:   	After the brand and brewpub are established, KBC would evaluate the increased production alternatives: 1. Use an outside contract manufacturer to produce the beer; or 2. Expand the brewing operations into a larger distribution center with a taproom. The difference between a taproom and a brewpub is a taproom does not serve food whereas a brewpub is a full-service restaurant that serves its own beer.

It is projected that this significant import trend will continue  for years to come. The 2015 year projects a growth rate of 11%.   	Due to a significant number of small and medium size companies that make up the secondary buyer's market, and the local culture of paying cash,  several large multinational trading companies have been able to take advantage of these factors. This results in country selling prices carrying a premiums of $60 to $100 per ton.   	West Africa Sugar Distributors LLC 's business model is simple. WASD has contracted with a Brazilian Sugar Refiner. The  two major points of the agreement are a very advantageous formula for our buying price,. This allows us a significant margin, that not only allows us to discount in country selling price, but  leaves us a very generous  gross margin per ton.   	The second major point  is the opportunity to draw purchased stock from our Refiner's West Africa warehousing facility. This will mean a four day transit time to the port of discharge, which will comfortably allow WASD to complete at least two 12,500mt shipments a month for a total of 25,000mts per month, 300,000mts annually.

Ultimately reducing operational cost and saving the Taxpayers money.   	SmartKiosk has lead the industry in innovative technology in correctional facilities since 2009 by implementing the first of its kind, two-way inmate email system inside a County Jail. Smartjailmail.com, an advanced controlled email system for inmates had never been heard of in a County jail at that time, but has proven to be a win-win solution for all involved. Achieving better communication, a paperless environment, improved jail security, huge operational efficiencies and a new revenue stream.   	Since the inception of the SmartKiosk system back in 2009 the SmartKiosk communication platform has expanded to many features that have ultimately transformed correctional facilities. Taking what was once an archaic outdated facility using hand written paper notes for communications between jail staff and inmates as well as inmates and citizens outside the jail, the SmartKiosk system has brought corrections into the 21st century by providing a complete electronic communications platform for inmates.The SmartKiosk has become a self-service station for inmates allowing all communication and all personal information for inmates to be now self service, documented and controlled, without the need for agency staff to be directly involved with daily inmate requests, questions, complaints, commissary orders, account balances or hand sorting and delivering inmate mail. This system massively reduces manual labor for correctional facilities every day, while providing the fastest cheapest form of communication for inmates since the history of incarceration.    	Our business model and what makes the SmartKiosk unique? In a nut shell, our system is provided totally free to correctional agencies. It saves the agency money, improves security, and provides a new stream of revenue. For the inmates, they can now keep in touch with friends and family in real time and at the same cost of a postage stamp, without having to wait 3 days for the mail to be delivered to them.

THE ISSUE...   	A lot of disabled or elder people have to leave their homes for senior homes or special treatment facilities because either their homes aren't accessible or homes don't have the tools needed to help them with mobility around their home. So they move into treatment facilities or senior homes rather than stay in their homes where they want to be. We can fix that.   	OUR SOLUTION AND SERVICES...   	Provide then with accessibility products so they can stay in their homes. for example:   	An elderly or disabled lady is stuck in her upstairs bedroom and can't get down stairs because it hurts so much to walk down the stairs. We can help - we provide them with stair-lifts to get them up and down their stairs.   	Or the little boy who hurts his leg while playing soccer and now needs his home modified so he could get around the home. We can evaluate the home and provide temporary measures to get him around the home.

According to the PEW RESEARCH there will be 74.9 million baby boomers in 2015. A lot of these hardworking folks want to remain in their homes as they get older.

"US10000027AA","Kyash Consulting","The overall goal of our business, Kyash Consulting, is to provide professional services to executive
agencies of the United States Government. These services will include information technology support, administrative management, management consulting, document preparation, and
public affairs support. As a small disadvantaged business, the federal government is likely to look
favorably on working with Kyash Consulting due to requirements saying that certain percentages of
contracting dollars must go to such small businesses.

Kyash Consulting is a start-up government contracting firm that will provide expertise and talent to various agencies and larger contractors. Since Kyash Consulting is opèrating in the Washington D.C. metro area, the prime market will be the United States government. However, that does not preclude Kyash Consulting from finding contracts with various state and local entities, as well as other private firms. Kyash Consulting would have a competitive advantage over other  start-ups because it is minority owned and will help government agencies and prime contractors reach federally mandated small/disadvantaged business contracting goals.

Kyash Consulting's value proposition is that we can perform quality work much less expensively than the competition because we are small (a father-son team), nimble, and carry very little of the overhead that characterizes most government contractors.","EquityNet","Services","Education","Professional Training Services","Herndon","VA","US","http://www.kyashconsulting.com","http://www.equitynet.com/c/kyash-consulting","Equity","Closed","2015-08-07 22:12:06","2015-08-07 22:12:06","","200000.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"US10000027DA","VICTIERY LLC"," 	 The main differentiator between VICTIERY and its competitors is the ability to seamlessly combine multiple sports/events in a single fantasy league. To do so, VICTIERY has designed a format and developed a unique proportional scoring method that provides consistency and comparability between sports/events. The multi-sport functionality of VICTIERY delivers endless action (without the unwanted maintenance). VICTIERY offers an unbeatable 12 sports/events, with a number of customizable options. This ensures that each fantasy sports player is able to participate in leagues that fit their interests.    	 How does a VICTIERY league work?   	 VICTIERY will release a schedule for each sport/event. The schedule format across sports/events is consistent, starting when tiers are released, followed by when picks are due, then any applicable cut dates (sports/events that do not run for a full season do not have cuts), and an end date. VICTIERY leagues begin with the first upcoming (or the only) sport/event in a given league and end with the last upcoming (or the only) sport/event in a given league.   	 VICTIERY will release tiers for each sport/event. The tier format across sports/events is consistent, but the number of tiers and the number of players in a given tier may vary by sport/event. The major sports typically have six tiers with roughly five players in each tier, but sports/events with fewer participants may have fewer tiers and/or smaller tiers.   	 As schedules and tiers are released for each sport/event by VICTIERY, fantasy rosters are assembled by picking players for each (or the only) sport/event in a given league (by position, if applicable) from tiers that are based on potential. In general, the intent is to have the better players in the upper (smaller numbered) tier(s) and the lesser players in the lower (larger numbered) tier(s). All contestants make picks from the same tiers so no one will be at an advantage or disadvantage as a result of how the players are tiered. This is similar to the salary cap format used by daily/weekly sites such as FanDuel and DraftKings, except instead of assigning players dollar values based on potential, players are assigned to tiers based on potential and players picked from each tier are required and limited. Both of these formats allow for picks to be completed in minutes (flexibility) and avoid the lengthy snake drafts used on traditional sites such as Yahoo!, ESPN and CBS – but daily/weekly sites require daily/weekly picks, which can be exhausting over the course of a given season.   	Once fantasy rosters are assembled, and each (or the only) sport/event in a given league begins, players picked start to accumulate statistics. The scoring format across sports/events is consistent, where players picked accumulate statistics, which are used to calculate a share of the total points available.   	 Scoring Example: Say there are 2,000.00 points available for statistic A for a particular sport/event in a given league. If a contestant’s picks accumulated 120 of statistic A, and the picks of all the contestants in that league accumulated 1,200 of statistic A, then that contestant would get one tenth of the points, or 200.00 points. The calculation would be as follows: [(120/1,200)*2,000.00] = 200.00.   	 This is unique compared to other sites where players picked directly accumulate points. However, this enabler allows comparability between sports/events. A contestant’s share of total points available is directly proportional to the statistics accumulated by that contestant’s picks versus the statistics accumulated by the picks of all contestants in a given league. As this suggests, this proportional scoring method keeps contestants competing against the entire league instead of using a random head-to-head (H2H) schedule.   	 A contestant’s picks accumulate statistics, which contribute to their total share of points, all the way up until they are cut or the season ends. Again, player cuts are made only for sports/events that run a full season and are made three times throughout the course of a season (as evenly spaced as possible). Player cuts are the only form of team maintenance required over the course of a given season. The cut format offers those affected by player injury a way to cut an injured player, at a scheduled time, when other contestants are forced to cut one of their players as well. VICTIERY doesn’t allow adding/dropping players (in the form of a “waiver wire”) or trading players with other contestants, as these tools simply introduce mechanisms for collusion.   	VICTIERY gives contestants more daily action and less daily maintenance. By (potentially) combining multiple sports/events in a single league, contestants can make each sport/event as exciting to watch as the other. VICTIERY gives contestants some “skin in the game” for each sport/event, whether it is emotional or monetary interest. League points are constantly changing and updated on a nightly basis. After the league/contest ends, contestants with the most overall league points and/or the most points for each sport/event “experience the thrill of VICTIERY”.

The ability for investors to know that the advice they’re following is backed by a truly successful track record along with the ability for traders to generate a monthly income for themselves based on their own trading success is a real differentiator for investFeed.  Our Keys To Success  	 investFeed currently supports thousands of users. One key to success will be the ability to scale our platform to include many additional trading vehicles such as futures, options and currencies as well as expand into other parts of the industry such as robo-advisory. Another key to success will be large scale distribution of our product. While our direct consumer marketing has proven the demand for investFeed, we will look to gain distribution through large channel partners with a global reach such as financial institutions, hedge funds, quantitative firms and retail broker-dealers. We are currently in active negotiations with several prospective partners.  Financial Summary  	 Within the span of several months, investFeed has gone from a couple dozen users to well over 8,000 and is now generating revenue. We are growing very quickly and our biggest challenge is a lack of capital in order keep up with the growing demand. Our initial seed round was completed in March 2015 when we successfully raised $100,000. In order to fund our rapid growth, we are now in the fortunate position of requiring a second seed round in order to begin the transformation from startup to becoming a globally recognized marketplace network.

"US1000002803","Antipodal Talent International, LLC"," 	Antipodal Talent International, LLC (the “Agency"") is a startup talent agency that officially launched on June 5, 2015, in Galesburg, Illinois, by Grant R. Gulovsen. While the base of operations is in the heart of the Midwest, the Agency's scope of operations is international, being the first and only talent agency in America that exclusively represents and promotes Chinese models and performing artists in the United States. In addition, the Agency has developed a set of ancillary partnerships that allow it to offer small to mid-size enterprises (""SMEs"") in the U.S. all the tools and information needed to get their goods into the Chinese marketplace and, with the help of the Agency’s models and performing artists, market those goods effectively once they arrive.   	The Agency was established to solve the following problem: Although middle- and upper middle-class consumer markets in China are set to triple in size to $3.2 billion USD annually by 2020, it is still very challenging for small to mid-size enterprises (""SMEs"") in the U.S. to actually enter the Chinese marketplace. As a result, the Agency is focused on helping SMEs that would otherwise not be able to afford the vast majority of consulting firms that specialize in getting U.S. companies into the Chinese marketplace. Given its unique characteristics as a hybrid talent agency and consulting firm, coupled with a target clientele that is currently underserved, the Agency will be able to stand out from the competition and make a name for itself in both industries.

"US3000002808","RevolutionCredit"," 	OurCrowd is investing in RevolutionCredit, the first Software-as-a-Service interactive behavioral analytics platform designed to help financial service providers make real-time credit decisions. The technology leverages real-time consumer behavioral data gathered from proprietary RevolutionCredit data modules.   	Making credit available to a sizable and underserved segment: FICO and other traditional credit scoring systems prohibit over 150MM consumers in the United States and over 50% of adults globally from accessing credit at reasonable rates. Recent immigrants, newly independent young people, people with damaged credit from the Financial Crisis, and many others with thin or nonexistent credit history face extreme challenges proving their creditworthiness to financial institutions. These consumers are often either “unscorable” or fall within what is termed the “broad middle” of the credit score spectrum, above chronic subprime but below super prime. For these millions of consumers, they are left with few options to access credit in the regulated marketplace. Consumers are further challenged when credit scores impact decisions outside of lending: credit profiles are often used for rental agreements, cell phone services, and in some states, insurance companies are allowed to use credit scores as an input for developing auto-insurance premiums. RevolutionCredit has created a viable alternative.   	Unique, forward looking analytics platform: RevolutionCredit offers a unique solution for a variety of financial service providers from personal loan providers to credit card companies and utilities companies. The company uses unique, forward-looking behavioral analytics derived from educational modules that consumers can opt-into while applying for financial products such as loans, credit cards, or post-paid services. These analytics have the ability to predict consumers’ likelihood of repaying their debts. The data RevolutionCredit has collected shows that their products allow creditors to increase customer acquisition and retention while decreasing loan losses. Consumers also see benefits as the products allow them to take control of their financial identities and prove that they are more than their credit scores.   	Solid traction from top-tier clients: RevolutionCredit generated $432K in revenue in 2014 and is projecting $1.1MM in revenue for 2015. The company’s unique platform has attracted a significant and diverse client base including MasterCard, Capital One, Enova, and Springleaf. Upcoming contracts include companies such as Ally, Chase, Discover, State Farm Bank, Regions Bank, Lending Club, Avant and others. OurCrowd believes that RevolutionCredit’s strong advisory board, which includes the former CEO of the Fair Isaac Corporation, former Senior SVP and COO of the American Bankers Association, and the former Chief Marketing and Credit Officer at HSBC, contribute to its ability to generate a strong pipeline.   	Veteran founding team with significant relevant experience: RevolutionCredit is led by senior executives who formerly held key roles at credit bureaus, financial services firms, and identity security organizations. CEO Zaydoon Munir has 18 years of experience in financial services, having spent over six years at Experian. CFO &amp; COO Laura Conrad was formerly CFO &amp; COO at Experian Interactive. CTO Rama Thamman was formerly a senior director at IdenTrust where he built innovative infrastructure solutions for the world’s leading banks. Additionally, the CMO and Head of Business Development each have over a decade of financial services experience. RevolutionCredit’s investors include Lerer Hippeau Ventures and Omidyar Network.

"US100000287C","HoodHop"," 	Hood Hop’s purpose is to enrich the lives of communities by bringing them together through transportation in a social, upscale, creative and affordable way.HoodHop's Mission is to provide a unique transportation service to designated cities and their brightly colored communities full of sub-communities and neighborhoods. Hood Hop will maximize the consumers social- community experience by making each neighborhood within cities accessible and more importantly a 10-15 minute fun filled ride away at a great value.   	Hood Hop is an exclusive transportation service company, initially serving San Francisco and it's widely spread and diverse neighborhoods. The company has been formed as a California Corporation with Paige Johnson as the Sole Owner. Hood Hop will be run by a fleet of Buses that serve San Francisco and it's unique neighborhoods. With pick-up and drop-off stops in various neighborhoods and districts, members will ride the bus lines to neighborhood-“hop” San Francisco and it's amazing offerings.   	As a young girl living in San Francisco, Johnson has always noticed something missing within the community, the ways in which she was circulating and approaching her city and the methods in which are available for consumers to do so. San Francisco is booming with diverse neighborhoods, all offering a unique experience but not easily accessed at an affordable cost or interactive and worth while way of access. Johnson’s vision is to create a bridge between transportation and community engagement with Hood Hop.   	Tourists and travelers will also reap the benefits of Hood Hops service, being able to explore much more of the city than a Taxi or Uber and their high prices and demands will permit. Tourists will also feel a strong sense of each community when riding along the bus lines and will be able to soak up some of the rich culture in just one night. Hotels and Hostels within each city advertise promotions with Hood Hop for visitors to enjoy a weekend pass membership at a discounted rate while traveling. Members will benefit from the low monthly cost of Hood Hop, although guests are welcome as well for a one time low fee, and referrals will gain rewards when bringing guests along. Hood Hop Members will not only benefit from the affordable cost but also feel an immense positive change in the way they approach their own city and are able to interact with the community and network with like minded individuals.
