"US100000005D","Joshua & Caleb Ministries","Most guitarists want to change guitars in the middle of their performance to add variety to their rendition but the process up till now has been extremely frustrating and cumbersome. That is why guitarists carry heavy awkward looking guitars or just settle for changing at the end of songs rather than in the middle. Some even use a vast array of guitar effects to try to simulate the change. Well the double sided guitar is here to solve that problem once and for all. With the double sided guitar, guitarists just flip to the other side of the guitar and play a totally different guitar. The objection we've had so far is that of perception, some guitarists think playing the guitar will not be comfortable until they actually play one.

In fact, these parties write off $80Bn ($350K on a per practice basis) in bad debt associated with the “self-pay” portion of health care bills each year! Said another way, bad debt for these groups = 15% of revenue!  myMedScore drops that by 1/3, or 100K!   	 Root cause: The reimbursement model of US healthcare. “Which part of the bill is mine???”  Accelerant: The Affordable Care Act, which will triple High Deductible Health Plans by 2020.                         “I’m insured.

"US30000004E7","Medlio","In 2000, patients were responsible for 5% of the total medical bill (mostly in the form of defined and easy to collect copays). Today, they are now responsible for 30% (mostly in the form of difficult to determine high deductibles and co-insurances).

Unfortunately, provider organizations are ill equipped to deal with this fundamental shift in payment flow. As a result, they are experiencing an unprecedented growth in patient bad debt, now a $100B problem. Medlio is solving this problem by pushing patient collections to the front of the revenue cycle.

Medlio’s web-based application for providers accurately estimates the cost of patient encounters before they occur, so patient-responsible balances can be collected on the front-end of a visit, prior to service. The solution takes the three key pieces of data: The patient’s benefits data & status, the provider’s contracted rates with the payer, and the expected bundled CPT codes, and delivers the cost estimate for the visit at check-in.","AngelList","Technology","IT Services","Healthcare Information Services","Durham","NC","US","http://medl.io","https://angel.co/medlio","Convertible Debt","Active","2013-10-08 02:58:04","2013-10-08 02:58:04","TRUE","2500000.0","0.00","","","7500000","","http://www.linkedin.com/company/medlio","https://www.facebook.com/Medlio","https://twitter.com/medlio","","","","","","20%","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

GoGoHealth has developed a platform that allows for safe, secure, and quick relief for these ailments.

Doctors determine how to treat illnesses, then dispense advice, a prescription, or -- if needed -- a request for an in-person examination.

The value to patients is clear: They get quick relief, get it from their own doctors wherever they are, and won’t skip seeking treatment.

The counselor’s time with students can be optimized by creating a culturally intelligent tool that students use to complete the guidance curriculum in an engaging, relevant and ""game-ified"" environment.

When children with autism are in a traditional daycare setting they may be physically cared for, but often they are not taught because the staff are not trained in special education.  Many of the children may be referred out of the program because of high behaviors and disruptions.  As a result many working parents get called away from work or have to quit their jobs in order to care for their children. Research shows that children who have autism should receive 40 hours of therapy a week.  Many programs through the state and school districts for this early developmental age range offer a small fraction of the intensive therapy that is recommended. The incidence of autism has increased from 1 in 150 in 2000 to 1 in 88 in 2008, so there is a need to provide these individuals with affordable, intensive, therapeutic services.

Evnt solves the problem of utilizing multiple services for media dispersement with our cross-platform media delivery platform.

Why Evnt is Needed? 

Social Media platforms are based on connections between friends and followers which restrict visibility on life events, personal, and global. We intend to transform media delivery into one based solely on pictures and videos in which there is unrestricted global access of digital media distribution.

Digestible Balloons promise the simplicity of pharmaceutical dosage with the weight loss profile of Bariatric therapy. PlenSat’s technology involves the production of ingestible ‘pills’ that are self-inflating in the acidic environment within the stomach. The expanded capsule, a “Digestible Balloon”, is sized such that once inflated it will not pass beyond the stomach. Preclinical pilot studies in dogs have shown that the capsules do inflate to the appropriate size to remain in the stomach for an extended time. The Digestible Balloon is ultimately broken down in the stomach over time and residual material is digested in the intestine and passed. ","AngelList","Healthcare","Med.

Problem / Solution

For those that have built a modern application you know connecting to each service’s API is a big pain and centralized services such as Singly aren't cutting it.

The Problem / Pain Points:
1. Singly acts as a single source for accessing these API's so there isn't any price competition.
2. Singly is a private centralized company, and so if it doesn't support the API you want, the developer is out of luck.
3. Since its not open source the developer can't see the back end of how Singly’s code is handling the data.

The Solution:
1. A marketplace where API providers compete on price with easy digital payments.
2. An open standard so anyone can add additional APIs.
3. An open source view into how all the data is handled so that developers can customize it for your application if you need a more powerful solution.","AngelList","Technology","Social Technology","Crowdsourcing","Austin","TX","US","http://www.APINetwork.co","https://angel.co/api-network","Equity","Active","2013-11-23 22:01:18","2013-11-23 22:01:18","FALSE","5000000.0","0.00","","","50000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A feature is a guest appearance of a musical artist on the song of another artist.  The feature can be part of the verse in the song or in the chorus section of the song.  A feature can also be part of the instrumental.

Examples:

Run DMC feat. Aerosmith ""Walk This Way""

Each of the members on our board of directors have either grown up in abusive households and or grown up and felt its effects through domestic violence. So we personally understand and empathize with the long term effects that emotional, mental, physical and sexual abuse and how it creeps into every aspect of a person’s mind body and soul. It is our goal to help curb the effect from forming a stronghold in those affected by abuse and violence. We are currently doing this by offering services to abuse shelters for makeovers and gently donated clothing. Other services to these people will be workshops in boosting their self esteem and getting them ready to reenter the world with a higher confidence level.

to the type of toys that a child likes.
Customer Problem: The problem is with getting kids to make their beds,

them a tie in to their toys. The coordination of interests and function allow
for multiple sales (i.e. my son loves cars and dinosaurs). I believe that the

Companies do not have a very good handle of where any given tire is located, how many miles are on the tire, and how long a tire has been in service. By using patent pending technologies/methodologies, this system provides the ability to track the tire from its incorporation into a customer's facility to the tire's expiration. A company will be able to determine where any given tire is located, how long it has been in service, and what the tire usage is.

Adagio ABL, LLC (the “Fund”) is a residential income real estate fund focused on meeting the demand for non-recourse bridge financing in the investor market and is managed by Adagio, LLC (the “Manager”). The Fund utilizes low-LTV mortgages in conjunction with various lease and option structures designed to generate an internal hedge against residential real estate market volatility via arbitrage.

The Manager views residential real estate value as a function of its net rental income as opposed to the popular comparable sales model. Historically, while comparable sales values have experienced significant volatility, Owner Equivalent Rents (“OER”), as tracked by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (“BLS”), have been relatively stable. Constructing arbitrage trades between income-based and comparable sales valuations has insulated the Manager’s portfolio from systemic risk, such as the crisis of 2008, while increasing overall returns.","AngelList","Financial","Real Estate","Real Estate Investments, Other","Fort Lauderdale","FL","US","http://www.theadagiogroup.com","https://angel.co/adagio-group","Equity","Active","2014-01-06 18:01:32","2014-01-06 18:01:32","FALSE","2.5E7","0.00","","","27500000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Extensive 5 year clinical studies and scientific research studies by prestigious research universities have proven PAL’s effectiveness and have shown that use of PAL® results in: (1) Earlier removal of feeding tubes (2) Earlier transition to oral feeding (3)  Shorten length of hospital stay and (4) Improved behavioral state control for drug-addicted babies.

"US10000013B0","Gift Card Combo"," 	The gift card industry has annual sales of over $100 billion in the U.S.  Some estimates are that as much as $20 billion dollars per year in gift cards is either lost, stolen, or goes unused.  Gift Card Combo aims to close that gap by providing services that allow consumers to store all of their gift card information in one place and to track the value of their cards.   	Gift Card Combo will develop a mobile application to link those gift cards to a financial account and a payment card, such as a debit card or a credit card.  When a consumer uses his payment card, Gift Card Combo determines if the consumer has a gift card with that merchant.  If a valid gift card is on file, Gift Card Combo applies the value of the gift card before applying the funds in the account.   	Gift Card Combo will be very attractive for our partners, such as banks and telephone companies because Gift Card Combo will charge a fee for this service and split it with our partners.  Also, since a payment card is required, it encourages young people to obtain bank accounts, which provides more incentive for banks to partner with Gift Card Combo. Gift Card Combo has filed U.S Patent Application No. 13/656,848 on the method and system for performing these services.   	Gift Card Combo also intends to sell and resell gift cards to the public.  Gift Card Combo will facilitate the exchange of privately owned gift cards between people who want to sell and purchase existing gift cards and will take a commission for doing so.   	Finally, Gift Card Combo will provide a digital wallet service to its customers.  Digital wallets digitize all of the cards and items in the customer’s wallet and is more secure because it requires a password for access.  Digital wallet applications and services are gaining a foothold in the market and are experiencing massive growth due to the large number of mobile devices. Digital wallets will be provided to individuals, families, and corporations at different rates.

Approved by eBay. Patent pending. 

Lately, at the request of merchants, Amazon  has introduced ""Make an Offer service. We automate that service.  We did that for eBay. 
Buyers and Sellers are prevented from closing large number of transactions because they are not able to negotiate with each other in real time. 

When a seller offers a product above what the buyer is willing to pay a sale is lost, when the price is too low a margin is lost. A tool is needed that will allow buyer and seller to negotiate and achieve an equitable price. OfferJar provides that tool.  

There is no other application available which provides this service.  

OfferJar is an innovative and new automated negotiations platform. By using a proprietary 2-way bidding algorithm, OfferJar aims to bring online retail to a new level of collaborative deal-making.

Current online retailers suffer from gaps in product pricing and buyer willingness to pay. There is a lack of information that allows sellers to appropriately determine the best price to offer each individual consumer, as such, many sales are left on the table.

Under all available applications there is a delay of hours, sometimes days to get a response to buyers’ offers. Because of that, very often the buyer completes the transaction at another venue. 

If it doesn’t work fast you into the next thing.  


OfferJar allows sellers to upload any and all unsold items and uses a seller directed toughness scale to offer negotiated discounts to buyers.  This allows the seller, at no cost in labor once it is set on auto-pilot, to achieve a sale that would otherwise not have occurred, and turn inventory over faster.

"US100000145F","Solafeet, Inc.","Solafeet, Inc. is a Florida corporation created after four years of product development. The company’s Solafeet ST-400 tanning bed for the feet is a patented design that eliminates the white feet/sock line tan associated with playing sports in the sun. It is being marketed to golfers, tennis players, runners, bicyclists, walkers, and all others who seek to solve the problem of their untanned feet. Utilizing four (4) powerful Wolff Systems tanning bulbs, the Solafeet unit will safely produce a natural tan with only 15 minutes of usage per day: while on the computer, watching TV, or just sitting in a chair. It’s ideal for golfers or tennis players who continue to tan their legs but not their feet while playing several times per week. In a spot survey in the Sarasota, Fl market covering  328 women golfers at 5 separate private country clubs, 322 (98%) complained of white feet. Many also indicated that their male companion had the same problem. With over 1.05 million women golfers at private country clubs and over 26.1 million total golfers in the U.S. alone, a large niche market is available. Adding together tennis (+25 MM), running (+11.5 MM), bicycling (+22MM), and walkers creates a sizable domestic market. Internationally, this market doubles in size. Solafeet will be a financial success if  >0.1% of the women golfers market segment is captured. Over 850 Solafeet units have been sold online at: www.solafeet.com. A random survey of purchasers had a 30% response rate, and every response indicated that they would recommend the product to a friend.
The units are manufactured in an ISO 9002 rated facility in Largo, Fl that meets all UL/FDA standards and is capable of producing 2500 units/week.  
The marketing strategy is to drive sales directly to the website instead of relying on distributors,  preserving the existing 105% markup over cost. An equity investment of $500K is being sought to proceed with the advertising strategy.","EquityNet","Consumer Goods","Personal Goods","Personal Products","Sarasota","FL","US","http://www.solafeet.com","http://www.equitynet.com/c/solafeet-inc","Equity","Active","2014-02-03 18:24:02","2014-02-03 18:24:02","FALSE","500000.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With most brands, it was not possible to buy direct through their websites and this was generally a result of their ability to still support and promote their existing retail base. Some brands use a ""dealer locator"" or a much higher price on their website as a solution which are not effective answers. With the founders having a history and background as brand manufacturers, they knew the problems and challenges dealing with online channel conflict. The Quivers team set out to create a solution that partners the brands and their retailers online; instead of competing against each other, the brand can now support their retailers.

TFT will generate billions of dollars of new revenues in an environmentally responsible way.

The revenue from the law company will be more than sufficient to service the debt. The law company was founded recently, but the principal owner has been a practicing lawyer for more than 20 years. He spent a lot of time managing a boutique law firm focused on securities and corporate law for more than 17 years. While securities law is certainly proving to be interesting given the new rules promulgated by the Commission, a great deal of the professional time is now devoted to Wills, Trusts and Estates.  We redesigned the law practice and changed it principal focus to allow the attorney to be able to travel extensively in Africa, Europe and the United States while continuing to practice law. Many state jurisdictions are changing the manner in which Probate Administrations is being handled. In short, they are leaving the paper filing systems in favor of electronic filing systems. This is favorable for a small legal practitioner because the filings can be done from any place as long as one has access to the Internet.

"US1000001545","SOA LEGACY, INC / Bernal Films","Bernal Films is seeking to raise $3.5 Million for the production of the Sci-Fi film ""Rupturian -Extinction on Earth"", primarily as debt financing, but would also consider providing equity for investment.

Rupturian is a rich concept that allows for the creation of a franchise, including movies, video-games, toys, clothing and cellular phone gadgets.  The Rupturian story happens in the present time, but  is about entering in contact with a highly advanced alien civilization, getting access to their advanced technology, for our benefit, but also with the perils of using it for our own destruction.

The first movie of the trilogy, ""Extinction on Earth"",  on purpose, doesn't have expensive scenes, so that it can be done with a budget of $3.5M.  The expensive scenes will come  later, in subsequent movies, once we have introduced the concept to the general public.

Extinction on Earth is about a major catastrophic event that will destroy life on Earth.  It follows the pattern of highly successful movies in terms of story, exotic ambiances, and worldwide general public.

The Rupturian story is rich in concepts, it has several angles, it has been compared with E.T. , the classical Sci-Fi movie by Steven Spielberg.

Research has also shown that Americans have a very deep relationship with their devices and have them close at hand both day and night.

The Kelly lease is approximately 40 acres in size and is located in Bakersfield Ca.

Some 15 wells were drilled in the 1940’s and ‘50’s and were produced for a time. However, when oil prices plunged in the mid to late 1990’s, the operation became uneconomic and the operator of that time simply abandoned the field. The California Department of Oil and Gas assumed operations and performed abandonment procedures on the existing wells in 2002, which left most of the downhole piping in place. We believe that we can utilize these wells to serve as production wells but new steam injection wells will need to be drilled and equipped.

Egbuchulam, as a sole proprietorship, is a start-up company that will be selling/distributing my new patented product Bell Boards.   Ever since I was a kid I loved to skateboard.  I use to take my skateboard everywhere because I found it cool, fun and exciting.  But I realized it wasn't an easy activity to do. As I got older, I started minimizing the use of my skateboard because it became less about it being cool or fun, and more about the most feasible way to get from place to place.  That is where a bicycle beats a skateboard.  It is a lot easier to ride a bike than to skateboard.   That's why more people ride bikes around the world.  When I came up with the idea of my company and product I wanted to create a new product line of skateboards that are as easy to ride as riding a bike, because there is a safer and more comfortable feeling biking than skateboarding.  I came up with the product, the Bell Boards.  Bell Boards are the only skateboards of its kind that combines the safety and comfort of a bike with the thrill of skateboarding. My company, Bell Boardz, offer types of skateboards whose primarily goal is to emulate that feeling of biking while skateboarding, that easiness.  With its dumbbell structure, foam padding, and ball wheels the Bell Boards offer THE easier alternative to traditional skateboarding without compromising the excitement.  My company is still in the developing phase so there is still some nooks and crannies that need to be worked out.  With room to expand the product line, such as room for additional products, multiple styles, qualities, and price ranges, the company and its product is poised for growth.   I, Lambert O Egbuchulam, am the founder and 100% owner of Bell Boardz, and anything else proprietary to it.  The company will currently operate from a home office.

Cebreros, CEO of Women of Coffee, is a pioneer in the sustainability efforts in the coffee industry and was the leader in visioning, developing and implementing the introduction of organic green coffee bean trading in North America.

Women of Coffee provides products and services that empower corporations, employees and industries to measure, track and ultimately increase activities that improve human engagement, environmental impact and profitability.  

The development of Corporate Cares was strongly driven by Cerebros’s vision: “We imagine unleashing the power of and potential of every employee to revitalize their community.”  With an already established, vertically integrated market in the coffee and beverage industry, Women of Coffee is expanding its reach to the larger corporate market.  

Women of Coffee is seeking a total of up to US $350,000 to market and sell Corporate Cares.  The company is selling 700,000 shares at $.50/share which represents 35% of the company.  There is a minimum investment of $5,000. 

Women of Coffee intends to buy back its equity from our investors in Year 5 based on a third-party valuation.  The investor can also choose to retain its equity until Exit Strategy is executed in later years.

Exit Strategy will depend on certain market conditions.  We have the option of selling the book of business to Profits 4 Purpose.  We would also look to anyone who could potentially buy Profits 4 Purpose to also buy Women of Coffee.  

Another potential Exit Strategy may evolve as other, larger players get into the sustainability cloud software industry and want to buy, rather than build a customer base.

By presenting the Art of Jazz Improvisation in the forum of pop culture, we will help promote the health and job making ability within our  endangered industry as well as our global understanding.  By auditions before a panel of the most eminent jazz performers and educators in the industry, a band of ambassadors will be selected to go to different countries as travel show hosts to tell stories of the artistic cultures and to hybrid our American jazz with the instruments, traditions and the people of the places they visit.  Over the course of the series they will emerge a new full length collaborative work of music to be performed at the end of the tour.  The series will be narrated by improvisational and comedic actors.  During our broadcast hours, we will also present a programming of jazz education shows.  They will consist of jam sessions, lectures, master classes, instrument classes, composition and theory, and chats where our customers can call or text in with their questions and have them answered in real time.  Technology to broadcast in this way is already available and the architecture of the website can be built without new invention.  Because of our minimal use of earth's resources and maximum employment of talent, the majority of our funding goals of $10,000,000 to begin operations will go to salaries for new jobs.

Sequencing requires preparation of uniformly sized DNA libraries and accounts for significant fraction of the final cost.  We are working on developing of novel approach of enzymatic generation of uniformly sized DNA pools. This will be a platform for quick and inexpensive library preparation for NextGen Sequencing.   	Without going into technical details, the main principle is control of termination: DNA polymerase will be forced to “freeze” when the product of certain, predefined length is synthesized. One particular implementation of the technology is “size-specific PCR”. Contrary to regular PCR, which is sequence-specific, size-specific PCR will be able to generate uniformly sized pools of DNA for only a fraction of current time, cost and amount of starting material.

The world market for microwave ovens is probably several billion USD.  It is commoditized, as the existing IP presently addressing this problem, to rotate the food, has long since expired.

A PCT patent application describing and claiming the novel microwave oven has been filed, allowing the possibility of an international monopoly.  

A royalty rate of 3% @ 50% adoption yields a potential value of ~$1,300M.  We anticipate ~70% penetration.

At the same time VETS USA Inc. will give investors the satisfaction of a decent return on investment.  The corporation will develop profit by participating with veteran owned businesses by profit sharing and interest on invested funds.  Many vets have gained knowledge and experience in certain fields that can lead them into starting a small business in that field.  What these vets lack is the proper guidance and knowledge in starting a business such as developing a business plan, learning business and tax laws, basics of accounting, obtaining capital, how and where to buy products, internet and social media advertising, banking issues and generally just running a small business.  The founder of this corporation has operated several small businesses over 50 years and is now at the age where other vets can benefit from his knowledge and business experience in several fields.  With the guidance of the founder who has two current businesses, vets can begin working on a part-time or full-time basis and gain experience and knowledge of business requirements and later take over management and ownership of the businesses.  The founder also knows other small business owners close to retirement willing to train and assist vets to acquire their businesses.  Running this corporation on a for-profit basis ensures continued capital available to generate more opportunities for vets with potential.   A panel of small businessmen recruited by VETS USA will interview potential vets, then guide, train, encourage and assist them in developing their future plus provide some necessary start-up capital,   Experience has shown banks, SBA or other entities will not typically provide capital for a start-up business and certainly not provide any small business knowledge and experience.

"US100000199A","No Boundaries Brewing Empire, inc."," 	No Boundaries Brewing Empire (NBBE) is a soon-to-be launched artisanal craft brewery along the Buffalo River in Buffalo, New York.  Co-owners Chris Carboni and Lou Ann Loveless have spent the last several years moving toward the goal of creating unique beer in a unique City of Buffalo location, giving patrons a truly fun, unique and tasty experience. “No Boundaries” means just that—NBBE ventures outside the conventional rules of beer making to offer distinctive tastes and textures not only from beer to beer, but from batch to batch.  NBBE celebrates the varied explosive flavors and the subtle notes which are often hidden or eliminated for the sake of uniformity in the mass marketed and even many craft brewed beers of today.  Brewmaster Carboni has been creating well-received, delicious beers since 2007. Carboni was joined by his friend and NBBE business manager Loveless the following year as demand began to outpace Carboni’s ability to keep up with demands for the small batches of beer created in his basement brewery. The last several years have been spent in due diligence, perfecting recipes, testing ideas, and searching out the ideal location for the brewery.   Over the last 8 months, a site was chosen and architectural design work began. Marketing strategies have been designed and implemented; including branding and the design of a logo and website.  With a lease secured for space in an historic building nestled among grain elevators and malt houses along the Buffalo River, NBBE has also begun the process of acquiring state and local licenses and permits for operation. Early design work for the space calls for a tap room, tasting room, banquet space, and an outdoor patio on the banks of the river. NBBE is proud to look over the horizon to a day very soon, when Buffalonians will be enjoying handcrafted, delicious, unique beer in one of the city’s up-and-coming locations, in the shadows of plans for both the Buffalo River/Silo City area and nearby Ohio Street.

Decades ago, I was looking into alternative energy sources that could compete with utility companies for providing electric. Back then, there were no tax incentives, nor were solar products even close to being reasonably priced. 
      Today, solar products in general have came down in price nearly 50% over the past two years, promising affordable solar power to everybody who wants it. Also, Federal Tax incentives are at 30% this year, with no maximum! These are just a few of the advantages of the ""Cube"" over conventional solar installed systems.

"US1000001A0F","Mister Bucks Pet Food Company","In 2000, Jon Kitto and Alonso Saldivar owned  a commercial service firm. Every day was a crisis--  the nature of the business.
As a diversion  they adopted a dog. They went to a  ‘Meet and Greet.’ There they met  a fawn , timid little girl.  They named her “GiGi.”
Gigi was shy and fearful. The solution was: “get another one!”
There was an  old boy that had just been saved from death.. He was in  the desert  starved,  hairless and covered with ticks.He had been adopted by a man who turned him loose in the desert to die.
Dying was not on his agenda.  However, upon entering their house, Buck jumped on the bed with pointed ears and tail wagging, as if to say the past is the past and life is for living-- let’s get on with it!”
Each day his strength grew and his fur grew back. He made a difference to Gigi who became confident and strong. Shortly after his adoption, it was decided that that dog had too much dignity to simply be “Buck,” so he forever more became “Mister Buck.”
Because of Mr. Buck's attitude,  the  business was sold and Jon and Alonso committed their lives to god, rescue and care. Soon Mr. Buck was leading  dogs in nursing home visits and working with children of incarcerated gang members. 

Since the time of first meeting Mr. Buck, Jon and Alonso have cared for more than 1000 dogs and had 52 of their own.

Mr. Buck lived an incredible 14 years and 6 months, passing Thanksgiving week 2009. He is buried in the Memory Garden at Greyhound Boarding & Retirement Kamp – GBARK- which Mr. Buck was responsible for founding.

To  to honor Mr. Buck’s memory and provide ongoing financial support for rescues everywhere,  “Mister Buck’s Genuinely Good Pet Food Company,” was created.  They have taken time and great care to select ingredients that have the quality to carry the venerated “Mr. Buck” name.

A portion of each purchase goes directly to  Animal Rescue with an  amount going to (GBARK).

"US1000001A42","Multi-Function Pet Bed","Linda Bledsoe . I  have designed a new kind of product that will help the 56 percent of dog owners that let their dogs sleep with them. I have a very large dog that sleep with us and he was all over the bed. So I made this design and it keeps him in a specific area of the bed and that is awesome. This can help the pet owner get a better night sleep.
Mine was just the cylinder. My co inventor suggested add flaps and it works great.   Not only does this help keep the pet in a specific area it also help keep the bed clean and it can help some dog owner who have had pet fall off the bed keep them from falling off. I have researched and some dogs have fallen off the bed and caused injuries to them selves.  This can also have many different fabric patterns to match their bed or bling can be added for those who like that kind of thing. In photos the one  shown with the dog on it this was the first one made so it was a little small for the dog but it shows the purpose. We have had a lot of positive feedback.  We have a Pat Pending .  Any help will be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

"US1000001A5F","Ad-Tech Media Sales "," 	B2B Lead Generation for Specialist Technology Companies.  Every technology Company Needs What We Offer.   They never say ""no"".  Marc Pickren is a 15 Year Technology Veteran and has a history of growing multi-million dollar lead generation companies.   His last company was names Fastest Growing Public Company in North Texas.   	In January 2014, Ad-Tech Media Sales was launched.  Our first step was to prove the solution as a ""Minimally Viable Product"" by beta-testing the solution on a brand new company that had no brand, no products and no website.  In short, we were going to see if the solution could generate enough leads to build a viable company in 60 days.   The results were simply amazing.   Too many leads, actual sales and a pipeline valued at over $250,000.   We address critical problems in selling technology in 2014:   	#1: Very few technology buyers use their office phones or respond to voice-mail.   The most viable method to reach buyers is through email, social and on their mobile devices.   We call this the holy trinity of lead generation.   	#2: Technology cannot completely replace personal nurturing or sector knowledge and expertise.  Its just that now they expect that nurturing to be offered electronically.   	#3: The number of new competing technologies is so hard to process that the timing of communications is critical to whether or not a company will get noticed.   	Key Takeaways: It takes six contacts to close a sale.  We generate 4 contacts in 72 hours and we shorten the sales cycle by months.  Which for SaaS companies can be the difference between success and failure.   	We use Advanced Marketing Automation (Email, Social and Mobile), Pixel Tracking and Expert Nurturing to deliver significant workable leads in as little as a few weeks.   	Our initial prospecting for our own efforts has yielded an impressive roster of prospects and deal flow.  From Google Ventures to CEO's of recent IPO technology companies.  The solution just plain works.

They can learn from the latest virtual business sales of Oculus Rift, the maker of virtual reality hardware to Facebook for $2 billion dollars. That was twice what Facebook paid for Instagram in 2012. They also purchased WhatsApp in 2014, for a reported $19 billion dollars.   A new investment class of non-accredited investors has been authorized in the United States to invest in private equity ventures. Successful individuals that are currently in the working middle class can now use private equity investing to move to new emerging investment class. Thanks, to a small business investment bill that passed Congress and was signed into law by President Obama on April 5, 2012, as part of the Jobs Act. This new law made it possible for non-unaccredited investors to invest in early stage business ventures for the first times, since the 1930s. The biggest challenge these small investors will face is where and how to find quality private venture to invest in. Many that are new to equity investing will turn to special event conferences and seminars to get information, before they invest.   Industry experts have estimated that when the law is fully implemented the pool of potential investors could expand from 2 million to over 50 million investors. We estimated that from 30% to 40% of all new business start-ups will use some form of Concept Funding that include crowd funding donations, business formation grants, equity and/or venture capital. According to industry research and the World Bank, Concept funding generated $5.1 billion in funding transactions in 2013 and will surpass $300 billion in equity funding transactions by 2025.

"US1000001B88","Rocky Mountain Oasis"," 	The leadership in North American churches and business are in trouble.  Leaders are severely over-worked and under-appreciated.  Severe burn out and career changes are a result.  Retreat facilities and conference centers are two things that are used to attempt to combat this ever growing problem.  However, both are inadequate on their own.  Retreat centers offer short term escape from the reality of everyday life; but reality still exists after returning from the retreat.  Conference centers teach attendees how to handle problems; but the solutions learned are nearly always conceptual and do not address the specific problems of the attendee. Rocky Mountain Oasis has combined the retreat center with the conference center and addressed the weaknesses of both.  An oasis is a place to escape the deadliness of the desert and to become refreshed and equipped to continue the remainder of the journey.  So is Rocky Mountain Oasis.  The Rocky Mountain Oasis experience begins with the oasis on the horizon.  We invite specific leadership teams to our facility and customize their experience so that they receive precisely the escape, the rejuvenation, and the tools they need to be able to go back out into life and complete the journey.  This begins with pre-stay interviews and preparations, continues with a time of retreat and conference at our facility, and culminates with post-stay follow-up and encouragement.  The Rocky Mountain Oasis experience ends when the leadership team has reached the edge of the desert and no longer needs nurturing or encouragement. Our owners (Joe &amp; Kathy McCarn, and Sharon Stoeber) have spent the past eleven years (and perhaps their entire lives) preparing for this endeavor.  With the right experience, contacts, and education, we are now prepared to help others to reach more of their potential.

Its industry-leading software platform connects those who need to ship cars with the brokers who arrange shipment and the truckers who provide the transport service.   	      It allows each party to the process to search for solutions, to evaluate alternatives, to contract for service, to  document vehicle condition, to track transport en-route and to pay or be paid upon completion. All in a single, seamless, end-to-end, paperless process.   	      The full-featured version of the platform was built for professional users: car dealers, auction houses, fleet owners, transport companies and transport brokerage companies.   	      As more vehicle transactions are taking place on-line, more individuals need to arrange vehicle shipment. Most have no experience and many make poor, and often expensive, choices. So we have also  created a version of the platform to serve the individual market.   	      The dominant product in our market  was introduced in 1999. It has not kept pace with changes either in technology or in the industry. Its strength is in its professional customer base, which has been offered little alternative over the years. However, that customer base is broadly dissatisfied with the product's lack of functionality and its focus on one participant in the transport chain -- the car dealer -- to the detriment of the broker and carrier communities. That product does not offer an option for the individual user.   	      Auto Load Logic was conceived and created by transport industry professionals. Our founders know the business from the ground up and that hands-on, in-depth knowledge informs both our product and our management.

"US1000001D31","Sail Freight International","Sail Freight International was the first company in this country to successfully use auxiliary wind propulsion system on modern merchant ships. Today we are still the only company in the world who has used AWP cost-effectively. The system was called COMSAIL and was used during the energy crisis in the early 1980s. Today we have improved our AWP system significantly. The new AWP system is called the COMSAIL Wing; it is fully automatic, provides real-time thrust analysis, has a lift coefficient six times greater and a utilization rate 20% greater. We already have a degree of interest from the shipping community so we are now looking to file two Utility Patents – one mechanical and the other for software. Provisional Patents have been filed but the Utility Patents must be completed by 1 September.  Ninety percent of everything moves my ship at some point. SFI will be looking to put AWP on tankers and gearless bulk carriers. The cost of fuel on these vessels is 70-80% of operating costs. The IMO and the USCG are pressuring ship  owners to reduce GHG emissions - ships are the sixth largest emitters of GHG in the world, behind China, Russia, India and Japan. Some ports are forcing ships to switch to shore-power while in port and lighter fuels while entering ports. There are very few options to reduce fuel consumption on ships. They include 1) traveling slower, 2) better hull coatings and 3) small adjustments to the main engine. In brief, the shipping industry needs to find a way to reduce fuel consumption and wind is one of the ways to do it; it is the only way to power a ship without increasing GHG emissions. Capt. Anderson, a principal of SFI, wrote his graduate thesis on how to equate hull roughness in terms of energy savings. This same technology will be used in one of the two utility patents being filed. The money will be used to cover the Patent filings and some of the overhead.

"US1000001D70","GoldKey Resources, Inc","A New Paradigm for Natural Resource Investment
GoldKey offers a new way to invest in natural resources that mitigates risk and maximizes liquidity while creating opportunities for long-term growth. Many, if not most, junior explorers and miners fail at the precise moment of greatest opportunity—after the discovery of a significant resource. GoldKey acquires or joint ventures with junior mining companies that have already taken the risk of greenfield exploration and identified promising prospects, but may be unable to bring a project to market or into production. GoldKey evaluates these prospects, completes geological work if necessary, analyzes the provenance/validity of mineral licenses and concession agreements, and then prepares properties for sale or trade to mid-tier or major mining companies, or enters into joint venture partnerships. 

Old Hands, New Ideas
GoldKey’s geographical area of specialization is Africa, particularly West Africa. West Africa is perhaps the most prospective gold region in the world. GoldKey has an extraordinarily seasoned team of exploration and mining professionals, investment and merchant bankers, fund managers, political and security analysts, and contract negotiators. The GoldKey team has owned, managed, bought and sold mines and mineral properties in Africa, advised private and public companies and sovereign governments.

"US1000001D77","LocalCustomer LLC"," 	LocalCustomer is a local marketing strategy platform. Our goal is to drive targeted, localized traffic and leads to small and medium sized businesses using multiple strategies and tactics. Most SMB verticals are still using antiquated marketing methods in order to reach their targeted customer.  There are literally hundreds of strategies and tactics that can be deployed. Unfortunately, SMBs have neither the time or specialized knowledge necessary to execute.   	LocalCustomer has developed a streamlined process which allows SMB's to implement a local marketing strategy and monitor the results from one centralized dashboard.  The LocalCustomer platform matches SMB verticals with certified vendors that may specialize in a specific strategy, tactic or niche. Once on the LocalCustomer platform an SMB can plug into multiple vendors without having to worry about setting up new accounts, losing data or even finding the vendor in the first place. LocalCustomer tracks these campaigns and the results which provides a more targeted, focused strategy to the next SMB who becomes a client within the same vertical.   	LocalCustomer provides its own packages for its clients with a heavy focus on customized, local videos that are used for video advertising, video SEO, and brand awareness campaigns within the target market. Our process allows allows SMBs to experience the same high quality production that larger businesses have afforded to do for years. Our team understands that video as a communication medium is the future of  online advertising.  In 5 years almost all online advertising will be viewed instead of read.   	Of the nation's 28 million SMBs  the ones who take advantage of this opportunity will have an incredible competitive advantage which will mirror the beginning of search advertising.

While this has been the ""platinum,"" standard for many years, there is a great deal of excitement today about identifying alternatives to pedicle screws. Currently, the main alternative is Facet Fixation, followed by Spinous Process fixation. Both of these techniques are expected to generate markets of over $ 2 B by 2017. Our lead product, the Faci-LOK, will be a safer, more technically facile, and faster alternative to all of these techniques. Additionally,  a number of other unique applications of this technology can be hypothesized which could address other fundamentally important problems in spinal surgery today.

"US1000001DE7","Innoventureica","We are a full service consultancy who serves the biotech,medical device, and pharmaceutical industries. I am the primary consultant and was the CEO of a medical device and pharmaceutical company and has either directed or partnered in the development of 4 industry products with portfolio that includes an innovative medical imaging modality, innovative medical imaging contrast agent, drug delivery system for neurodegenerative diseases, and eye dispensor intended for glucoma patients. Three of the four products were developed by my company and I have a portfolio to demonstrate these accomplishments. My mentorships include an extensive work (for near two years)  with former CEO of EG&G (John Kucharski) and Harvard educated physician (Dr. Kerrin White). I have mentored under  others as well.

Currently, I have a bachelors of chemical engineering from a tier 1 university (World News and Reports 2014) and have applied to law and  doctoral programs throughout the US  to further my credentials out of necessity to conduct business and to support myself and family.  

The purpose of  raising funds is to pay or help to pay for graduate school since all assets were taken in a divorce and appropriate employment prospects have been nil. I intend to start another company in the life science industry after school. 

I have been part of legislation intended to minimize risk for real property owners internationally. Recently, I participated and supported  new legislation (via the SEC) intended to assist fundraisers. 

The details of the funding campaign, protocols, and capital structure has been determined and will protect fundraiser and funder alike. Of course, the details will have to be discussed and negotiated since I am open to different types of financing. Obvious investors will be future partners, philanthropists, potential board members, or those  seeking innovative treatments, etc.

Each product is produced with just enough difference from every other existing product  currently on the market to give that all important ""unique selling proposition."" Everything from brand name, brand imagery, advertising slogan, advertising strategy has been developed over many years of research along with the intuitive likes of the end consumer - from sports to art to lifestyle preferences.

Our target market is, obviously, beer drinkers.  All kinds of beer drinkers.  Millions of beer drinkers.  And while they all may have differing tastes in which beer or beers they prefer, they generally consume other food products while they are enjoying their beer of choice.

What makes this effort even more unique is that every product will be produced by a leading supplier in the category of the specified product line.  Just to give one example; Oxley's Extra Potato Chips will be unique, from the type of potato used, the chip style and even the salt used.  They will be produced by one or more of the leading potato chip manufacturing companies in the country.  

The companies producing the Oxley's Extra line of beer-related products will handle the sales and distribution of all Oxley's Extra products and be incentivized to by additional profits resulting form those incremental sales - sort of a reverse private-label program.

Crowdsourced content has proven to be highly effective and acceptable by national brands, as evidenced by many popular online ads and past Superbowl commercials. We take the same crowdsourcing approach used by a few innovative brands (e.g. Doritos) and apply it to a wide variety of products and services. Our reach to the world internet user base (currently estimated at 2.4B) is driven by Amazon's Cloud technology, our patent-pending website and an expanding focus on social marketing.   	  Our vision is to become the nation's leading supplier of video ads and leverage this capability to expand into related business areas. For example, we plan to launch a new division next year that will specialize in using video ads to promote products/services through social websites. This will provide a means for our existing clients to maximize the value of their Crowdsourced ads and give Bizzler a built-in client base for the new business entity. In addition, the marketing service will be offered as a standalone service to companies looking for a means to promote their offerings via social media, fueling growth of the new marketing division and creating sales connections for the ad generation business.   	  Our website &amp; team are ready to go and we have the networking in place for capturing new business at the executive level from a long list of major brands. We are seeking $1M in Series A equity financing to use primarily for starting operations and launching an aggressive sales and marketing campaign.

"US1000001EEA","Eye Phone","Eye Phone App... How Does it Work? As currently designed in the technical drawings and 3-D models, the app has unique features not presently available in the marketplace.  Although the programming has not yet been developed and is still in the developmental stages, an explanation of possible operation is as follows: The primary function of Eye Phone is to help the user better see, read, and type on their phone or tablet. The user will be able to adjust the phone or tablet screen to their eyesight. Since the user will not always be the same distance from their phone or tablet, the user can have several different focus settings saved to the app. This will allow the user to quickly and easily adjust the screen for their eyes. The user will have the option to focus the screen three different ways, by prescription strength, an eye chart or manually adjusting the screen.

What Problem(s) Does it Solve?

The unique features of this app will provide the following benefits for all consumers:
• Allows the user to adjust the phone or tablet screen to their eyesight

• Saves the user time and energy by not having to squint to read their phone or tablet

• Gives the user 3 different options to adjust the screen

Marketing
Mr. O’ Connor envisions his product appealing to multitudes of consumers worldwide who use     their “smart phones” not only for communication but also for innovative solutions. The markets are extensive for an ingenious app like Eye Phone; Google Play and iTunes are the most popular app stores in the primary market and are the ideal places to market this app. However, for the Android version of the app there are several new stores popping all over the cyber world such as, AppsLib, Samsung Apps, F-Droid, Slide ME, GetJar, and Amazon App Store for Android. Mr. O’ Connor wishes to leave the market open for subsequent variances and possibilities that could improve the feasibility and marketability of his product.

"US1000001EF4","HoverWind LLC","HoverWind LLC  (HW)was formed to become the market leader in manufacturing and distribution of Personal Hovercraft .  Hovercraft’s unique advantage is the ability to travel over widely diverse terrain. They literally “hover” over land, water, mud, ice and other surfaces, both at speed and when stationary. Hovercraft can transport higher payloads, with less horsepower and fuel, than any other mechanized craft.  There are no other powered vehicles that provide the versatility of hovercraft … OR THE FUN!

HW will initiate operations as the only hovercraft dealer of hovercraft in the State of Florida through exclusive dealership relationships with the two of the three leading recreational hovercraft manufacturers in North America.  HW has formed relationships with two of these entities effectively ‘rolling up’ two thirds of the domestic competition and the largest manufacturer in the United Kingdom and is in position to build and dominate the market for Personal Hovercraft.

The US market for our hovercraft overlaps three segments of the Power Sports market, Personal Watercraft (Jet Skis), Snowmobiles and All Terrain Vehicles, in addition to segments of the Recreational Boat market. These segments generate approximately $4 billion in annual sales. Jet Skis and Snowmobiles are the most applicable segments. Jet Skis and Snowmobiles generated US sales of $987 million in 2013. HW will initially focus on these market segments by being the first to raise awareness of the fun, excitement and utility found by owning a Personal Hovercraft.

For the last thirty years there has been no serious new product introductions in the Power Sports market. HW intends to fully invigorate this market.

"US1000001F2B","Emelody Worldwide","Emelody Worldwide Inc. is a conglomerate corporation focusing  on technical consulting and innovative inventions. The company contains two divisions entitled Emelody Research Group and Emelody Inspirations Group. These two divisions are coexistent and support each other in various endeavors. 

For example Emelody Inspirations Group currently maintains and supports the development of a radical next generation UAV aircraft, while the technical research group supports it through various calculations and recruitment. The focus here however is to introduce our flagship aircraft entitled “Vindicatore” which translated from Italian means avenger.

Our product is a modern UAV design using existing aerodynamic and mechanical design. Currently the UAV industry has attempted to use current technologies and apply them to a new problem. However what should and needs to be done is use current technology in a new and innovative fashion. We are not attempting to reinvent the wheel or change Bernoulli’s equations. What we are attempting to do is use modern methodology and technique and views the box from a different perspective without breaking principles. Our technology implies high factors of improvement in the areas of range, and maneuverability using technologies from fixed wing and rotary wing flight dynamics without the negative effects of each. For example aircrafts do not typically take off vertically, and helicopters do not distinguish between lift and thrust, which gives margins of inefficiency in ranged performance. This proposed concept compromises and improves the two traditions. The use of redundant flight vehicles and minor fabrication to existing technologies does not provide a leap in thought and human expectation. It is time for a new paradigm in flight vehicles and we are here to do that and alter the expectation of what a flight vehicle consists of.

* Video and other media as evidence 
* Evaluation form as part of EMR

Go Eval is a software mobile / cloud application that allows users to take videos while evaluating their patients. They can then securely deliver the results to insurance companies using a unique encounter ID and Password for each patient or encounter.

Go Eval uses industry standard encryption for data security and can even be used in other fields, like real estate, autos, business, and even the legal industry.

* You can Take a video on YouTube and send a link to the insurance company to prove your point But Thats not secure, nor can you take multiple videos, photos, have questions and answers.
* You can fill out evaluation forms on your EMR / Patient Management Software and even attach videos and photos but can’t send it to third parties securely.

The long-term strategy of the company is to deliver a publicly-traded company with long-term production and reserve growth by building a performance driven energy portfolio. The company’s strategy is achieved through a balance of oil and gas plays with downside hedges and upside price appreciation, vertical integration of services to positively impact bottom line revenue.   	Central to the plan of Wyutex is the acquisition and implementation of its investor strategy.  Exploration and development of energy resources is defined by risk.

"US1000001F61","Monitor My Meds ","The phenomenal growth of our senior population coupled with their overwhelming desire to remain independent in their homes has created an immediate need for people, products and services that can help achieve that goal. The nation’s population of people 65 and older is expected to slightly more than double, to 86 million from 41 million in 2010. Of that increase, the 85 and older is the fastest growing segment. According to an AARP survey nearly ninety percent (90%) of those over 65 want to stay in their residences for as long as possible, and eighty percent (80%) say they believe their current home is where they will always live. Caregiving is one of the fastest growing employment sectors and tele-health  has a large focus on monitoring the senior population in their homes. US News 100 Best Jobs for 2014 includes nearly forty percent (40%) of the picks in the health care industry.  Monitor My Meds   know known as Stay Independent  provides easy to use and inexpensive tools for caregivers to help seniors remain independent.The caregivers are home care, geriatric care managers, senior independent living communities, hospital discharge and family caregivers.  Most of these markets are B to B except the market for family caregivers.Stay Independent is a sophisticated care management platform that links caregivers and seniors,  including family, and monitors the independence of their client/patient. At its simplest level the platform provides personal communication messaging to and from the senior by telephone, cellular or analogue, requiring no equipment, installation, training or internet access on the part of the senior being cared for. It also provides a secured account where healthcare professionals, caregivers and family members can share information through notes and adherence charts.  The service is used as an introductory service by home care and senior communities to distinguish their service offereings. .

Mysafeplace is launching shortly and  is a cloud based service which means low overhead, controlled costs and scale.

Our time management features include to-do lists, contact directory, cataloging, goal setting, calendar features and more.  All designed to increase personal productivity and keep you organized. 

The goal of mysafeplace is to become a tool for people to effectively  preserve and protect the important  items in their lives and to help manage their day to day activities.

There are three levels of service.  The Single Plan is only $5.00 per month.  It provides 10GB of storage and all features are included. The next level is the Family Plan for $15.00 and adds more storage and 5 members to this group plan.  Each has their own personal space and a shared group space.  You can imagine a family creating a family photo gallery and still have separate personal galleries.  The next plan is the Community Plan for $25.00 and adds even more storage and expands to 10 group members.  Ideal to keep a small business, or extended family connected.

Shortly after launching we have plans for a business offering with expanded features specific to manage a small business.

These events have personally impacted our lives. With the creation of the smartphone and advancements in technology we developed MyForce as unique personal security service that protects our members and provides them and their family's peace of mind.

In addition, our service is easily integrated with college and university campus security programs – allowing campus law enforcement to receive and respond to on campus alerts. MyForce has already been integrated on ten campuses nationwide.   Our Keys To Success  	  Our key to success is scaling and introducing our service to a much larger audience, which will require additional capital.    The MyForce service is already supported on 10 campuses nationwide; with planned roll-outs scheduled for fall of 2014. We’re in active conversations with multiple large channel partners including a larger national insurance provider and wireless carrier.

"US1000001FD8","Tradersmail.com"," 	A few months ago, I was trading very actively and letting my brother and a select group of friends know what I was doing. . My brother, Larry, who is a professional trader, was doing the same thing not only with his equity trades but also with is FX and futures trades. Larry also writes a newsletter that he distributes to about 50 people. He lets his subscribers know what he is doing as well. This is all very manual and this practice has us typing multiple emails during the course of a trading day.  When the market closed I called my brother and said ”man I wish I could let all of my friends know about my trades as soon as my order was executed. I wish there was a way to connect my electronic trade ticket to an email”..  The application would allow traders to send an email to a pre-determined and pre-populated list as soon as they execute a trade. So for example a client of TD Ameritrade could place an order and as it is executed an email goes out to his select group he chooses to let know his trade has occurred. Maybe it is members of his investment club or others in his IBD Meet Up group.  Prop traders could let their colleagues across the room or across the globe know what they have just traded. The application could have compliance uses as well. This would allow compliance officers to keep tabs on certain brokers or traders in their firm when they travel for example. Money managers or financial advisors could let their clients know in real time what they have bought or sold. Small (non-market moving hedge funds) could, if they choose to let their investors know that they have just bought, sold, hedged, or shorted.  In addition this could be used across all asset classes, futures, equities, options, currencies, fixed income and firms globally could be targets.

Rough Cut Films consists of two professionals who pride themselves on their ability to create inventive and inspired material and to attract creative collaborators with an authentic voice. We also partner with other production companies to develop and produce projects across a wide range of genres.   	Rough Cut Films is a young company with a firm understanding of popular, classic, counter, urban, youth, and world cultures; and we bring that interest into each of our projects. We recognize the current creative imperative that is driving the paradigm shift away from large studios producing the most relevant films. This allows Rough Cut Films as an independent production company the unique opportunity to fill the content gap and focus on making movies with a ""big studio"" look for very low budgets.   	Based in Chicago, Rough Cut Films was initially created to produce the film DEAD GIRLS [©2014], with scheduled  release in November 2014. That film was financed through our close personal and business network, and now we are moving forward towards making more macro- and low budget features through more traditional financial streams. We make genre films. While the big studios continue to adapt features from other media, the realist is that most of the time, movies with smaller budgets provide small and medium sized production studios with the most bang for their buck. Typical genres include: horror, thriller, action, comedy, and crime films.   	Whether focusing on films that highlight various social and cultural issues, or through producing the most lucrative genre projects for the commercial market, the principals at Rough Cut Films use their experience, determination, and innovative spirit to produce engaging material. These tenets are what makes Rough Cut Films a new and important voice in independent entertainment that reaches beyond the boundaries of tradition.

The entrepreneurial spirit is alive and well in the United States and around the world.

I'm merging the two talents and looking to create a small empire of actual gentlemen's clubs in strategic locations beginning in New York.

The goal is to create ""double-threats"", or equity strong real estate with a consistant revenue stream boasting a 35-45% annual profit margin for long term viability  while building a brand and reputation on the way. Gentlemen's clubs are mathematically consistant, almost recession proof, and predictable from a projection standpoint as long as you are able to read and adapt the golden rules to the club's current surroundings. Each club has a numerical ($) annual gross capacity which is given to you by the fire marshall in the form of the maximum patron capacity....It's that clear and much easier to obtain than operators make it look.  The ultimate business goal is to create a high class ""chain"" in desireable geographical surroundings and focus on maintaining a steadfast commitment to keeping revenues at club capacity and meanwhile compounding smart real estate equity. It's very similar to the approach of Rick's Cabaret uses but on a much smaller per investment goal. Instead of looking for 15,000 square feet in Manhattan for 10Mil minimum, I'd target surrounding areas with 50,000 plus cars per week traffic flow, median incomes, real estate market stability, and initially target gross investments to full operation at under 3Mil....there are plenty of deals out there right now that are at  60% or less PTV, with equity there for the taking .Alot of these already have a 500k+ revenue streams.

"US1000002072","StoreGenie ","The StoreGenie marketing platform and CRM delivers the long desired one-to-one to marketing capability that individual brick and mortar retail stores and chains need to compete with e-commerce.

StoreGenie is based on the insight that every time a shopper interacts with a retail sales associate, the sales associate learns highly detailed information about the shopper’s preferences and interests but currently this information is lost as soon as the shopper leaves.

The second part is an applicator that  holds 1 or 2 colors of paint. The painting process is easy. Start each wall in any corner, allow each pass to slightly overlap the previous pass, add more paint to the applicator after every few passes, and go!       The business plan is to open a retail store in a mall so people can see the beautiful results. Some people will buy the product and do it themselves. Others will hire one of our licensed painting contractors to do the work. Once this business is shown to work in one mall, it can be franchised and expanded to thousands of malls around the world.      Our design rollers are made in the USA.  We are the only manufacturer in the Americas and plan to stay that way because we use special equipment and trade secret technology. We can even make custom designs at a modest cost.

Nollywood also produces large amounts of content, up to 50 movies per month. Nollywood is an emerging market that will see an increase of followers in the United States in the upcoming years.
The success of Netflix has shown a shift in the way we now watch programming. Today, many companies and cable networks attempt to duplicate the success of Netflix's video on demand service. There are other platforms specifically for Nollywood films. iRockoTV is considered a direct competitor. Unfortunately, iRockoTV is rather expensive ($7 per month to watch Nollywood movies). Their apps also have issues. And at times, their movies will stop playing. MiFi will be affordable, $3 for MiFi basic and $7 for MiFi. Also, specializing in user interface and user experience, as well as superior streaming and playback, MiFi will offer users a personal and enjoyable experience streaming through all the latest and retro Nollywood Films. MiFi's tech team will keep the apps and content updated to insure an enjoyable experience. 
But perhaps the biggest draw for MiFi is its vision. After the initial launch, MiFi will begin to develop original content. MiFi will also introduce MiFi tours, which will take advantage of the growing popularity of African artists in America. Furthermore, MiFi will attempt to set up a partnership with Tyler Perry.

"US1000002099","RF Controls LLC","RF Controls is uniquely positioned to usher in the Internet of Everything era. Founded in 2006 in St. Louis, the company’s revolutionary antenna technology allows for previously unforeseen advances in RFID technology by eliminating barriers to end user adoption while reducing infrastructure costs.

RF Controls’ smart antenna hardware and software enables application of passive ultra-high frequency (UHF) RFID in real time location systems (RTLS). RF Controls’ bi-directional electronic steerable phased array antennas, which are core components of its Intelligent Tracking and Control System (ITCS®), use patented antenna technology to send a signal to a passive RFID tag, excite the tag (wake it up), and capture and read data from the tag. RF Controls real-time location systems are the only products in the world capable of tracking UHF passive RFID tags in real time, with accuracy of 12 inches.

RF Controls has been awarded a foundational patent for its Intelligent Tracking and Control System. ITCS is best classified as a wide area RTLS  because ITCS provides much more than just tag identification data. By installing ITCS “smart antennas,” end users can illuminate an area (or volume) in which tagged items move or are stored, and achieve real-time, perpetual monitoring of an entire warehouse or retail floor.

Fourth, from short term financing of wholesale properties through various means. Our principal objective is to generate attractive investment returns for Roth retirement accounts.

"US100000210E","Bloomery Plantation Distillery","Seeking 120 investors/$5,000 min. — $600,000/10% equity.

With our sweet spin on moonshine, we’ve polished up an old tradition, creating award-winning, world-class liqueurs that range in proof from 8° to 70°. 

At Bloomery Plantation Distillery, we take a stand against boring unadventurous drinking, so we set on a mission to break away from this. For starters we went back, way back, to the way the old timer’s used to do it. They would flavor their moonshine with real fruit and sugar for a smoother, more palatable ‘shine. Bloomery’s all natural SweetShines® are made the way the old timer’s used to do it, by hand, with 190-proof corn likker, pure cane sugar and farm fresh ingredients. We grow lemons, yes, lemons in West by God Virginia! And Hawaiian ginger, raspberries, black walnuts and pumpkins. What we don’t grow we try to source from other small American family farms. Farm to table. Garden to glass. Our farm-fresh ingredients are hand-picked, hand chopped, hand zested or hand squeezed. Why do we do it? Flavor! All natural flavor. And it really shows. 

The Distillery opened in September, 2011 and has amassed 20 international medals. It  is located 2 miles east of Charles Town, WV, and is situated on a 12-acre parcel of land where the Shenandoah River meets the Blue Ridge Mountains. Our production and tasting room experience take place in a rural two-story 50’x 16’ historic log cabin in the woods. We deliver a WOW experience in that tiny tasting room, and wherever we go for that matter. From our award-winning labels and SweetShines®, to our traveling road show, we are unique, exclusive, all natural and farm-fresh. Just the bare essentials. Beautifully focused and stark-ravingly good. 

Although our all natural cordials are made by hand, the old-fashioned way, it’s not to say we think small. We are scalable in every sense of the word, and have detailed plans to take our history, hooch and hospitality to the national market.

IntelyDine is a unique restaurant rating & reservations application-engine developed by Dione Infotech from Charlotte, North Carolina is ready for launch in Jan/Feb 2015

Problem: What does a 3 star rated restaurant mean to you? Does it mean that the food tastes good? That the tables are always clean? That the service is good? Most restaurant rating applications in the market have a ‘5 star’ based rating system, but these rating systems are ambiguous to the user as to what criteria they are based on. Reviewing some of the customer comments, there is a marked difference between the ratings and comments. The absence of a set criteria makes the rating unreliable and misleading.

Solution: IntelyDine solves this problem by asking 10 simple questions relevant to the customer's experience and they are rated on a scale of 10 points for each question, thereby totaling to a maximum score of 100. These 10 simple questions can be answered in 10 seconds or less using the slider scale.

Our major advantage over our competitors:
 
>	Our biggest competitor Yelp is only a rating engine and relies on 3rd party systems for reservations. IntelyDine has its own in-house rating and reservations engine.

>	OpenTable is currently the only reservation engine and they charge premium rates around $400 - $500 per month versus IntelyDine’s charges that start at $25 per month.  

>	IntelyDine RCM (Restaurant Customer Management) is a parallel application. It effectively manage negative/positive reviews besides other functionality. This is done using a workflow methodology that allows restaurants to apply remedial measures, initiate customer communication and award rewards, thereby converting a negative customer experience to a mutually beneficial scenario.

"US10000021B4","Visual Gas Imaging, LLC  (VGI)","Visual Gas Imaging , LLC (VGI) is a methane gas leak detection company that will service the upstream oil & gas gathering industry. Given that Methane Gas is the primary component of natural gas and is a potent greenhouse gas, reducing methane emissions can result in environmental, economic and operational benefits. Four continuously evolving factors are driving the necessity for leak detection services to the Oil & Gas Industry, and in turn will ultimately drive the success of VGI.
1. Emerging Infrared Technology- Allows previously invisible and undetected gases to be ""seen"" and recorded escaping from components at the wellhead and      throughout processing.
2. Safety- The leaking gas is highly combustible posing considerable risk to personnel.
3. Economics- Due to the corrosive nature of minerals coming straight from the earth, it is not a matter of ""if"" a leak develops, but ""when""! The escaping gas can be quantified and a dollar amount applied that offsets  the costs of VGI's services.
4. Recent studies, rulings and regulatory guidelines are ongoingly being implemented to measure and regulate the amount of greenhouse gases being released by Oil and Gas Operators. Secondly, they give the EPA the ability to use the same Infrared Technology to detect leaks resulting in citations and monetary fines.
    
Creating a business model around these factors will result in a company that provides a necessary repetitive service that benefits the environment and protects the companies and thier personnel within the industry.

"US10000021B8","Disaster Preparedness, dba Fortitude Ranch","Scientists say bioengineered viral pandemics (BVP) are inevitable.   It is increasingly easy to modify an existing pathogen to make it more lethal or transmissible, or design new viruses. We are not prepared for surviving a viral pandemic, major electromagnetic pulse (EMP) strike, or other disasters.  Many “survival community” businesses are growing in the United States, offering underground shelter and stockpiled food and emergency supplies to survive societal collapse.  Disaster Preparedness LLC (DP LLC), doing business as “Fortitude Ranch” , offers survival facilities in a different manner than competitors.  Our shelter communities are useful now as hunting, vacation, bed and breakfast, and resort sites:  “Fortitude Ranch: Prepare for the worst, enjoy the present.” This offers far more value to customers and more sales and profit for the business.  We have one location in West Virginia and a small recreation only site in Colorado that will be replaced by a full size Fortitude Ranch (FR) location.  With this small capital raise we will open up FR locations in CO and WI, purchase land for additional locations in NV and TX, and identify land and contractors for a total of 12 FR locations.  We will operate a few locations while waiting for the “Event”—a major media episode or disaster that spurs a jump in awareness of collapse threats and need for survival community protection. When this occurs we will immediately allow only higher margin long term memberships and quickly sell out the 12 FR locations and reap a huge return on investment.  We are an “Antifragile” investment since this capital raise goes primarily to land purchase and low cost buildings, which will likely appreciate in value.  If there never is any “event” that leads to huge sales and profit, our downside is return of capital by selling off our land and multi-purpose buildings.","EquityNet","Services","Real Estate Services","Real Estate, Other","Arlington","VA","US","http://www.fortituderanch.com","http://www.equitynet.com/c/disaster-preparedness-dba-fortitude-ranch","Equity","Active","2014-10-22 01:19:42","2014-10-22 01:19:42","FALSE","4000000.0","710000.00","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"US10000021BE","MyKidsCalendar"," 	 MyKidsCalendar (MKC) is an SaaS application targeting competitive youth sports teams with complex and frequently-changing schedules: travel/elite/select teams in all sports, high schools, dance, cheer, and gymnastics businesses.  We’ve acquired over 300 subscribing customers in the US since 2006.  MKC is mature, and technically sound, but marketing investment and expertise is required to accelerate growth.  The MKC business derives revenue from 4 sources:  monthly subscription fees, email advertisements, on-line and mobile ads, and a program we call MKC-ad, which gives our users an opportunity to raise funds by selling the ad space on the emails sent from MKC to their Parents.  Groups lease the email ad space from MKC, and then collect revenue from local advertisers, keeping the difference for their organizations.  MKC is designed to be easy-to-use, self-serve, and focuses on the most critical and heavily-used features needed by competitive youth sports coaches and team managers.  This renders the MKC system highly scaleable, and minimizes support and computing resources needs.  MKC has been self-funded by the founder and his family since it's inception in 2005.  Total cash investment exceeds $110,000, and the founder has not taken any salary, bonus, or dividend over the company's history.  Marketing and sales investment has been limited, and yet hundreds of customers have subscribed to the service.  Development and other functions have been accomplished as inexpensively as possible using contractors located in the US and around the globe.  We believe that the company can grow exponentially with the appropriate investment in prospect conversion tools, site design enhancements, and marketing.  A viral business model is implied by the company's operational baseline:  coaches/administrators purchase subscriptions, then register the parents of their athletes.  So, one customer exposes 10 to hundreds of others to MKC for the cost of acquiring just the one customer.

"US10000021F5","Credit Re-Inventors "," 	Page | 4 Executive Summary Credit Re-Inventors is a Limited Liability Company, [CRI] based in Columbus, Ohio that will do business in the 9.8 billion dollar industry of credit repair. This industry continues to enjoy a 4.9% annual growth rate since 2006. What [CRI] finds so exciting is that no company has more than a 5% market share. This makes the credit repair industry prime for startup opportunities. The primary opportunity lies with over 25% of the US population having average to poor credit. Poor credit is represented by a fico score below 600. This is costing the consumer higher interest loans on housing, autos, credit card and insurance payments. Poor credit can even result in lower wages, underemployment, and total missed job opportunities. The cause of bad credit can be very complex. Real life circumstances such as divorce, loss of job, illness and death are contributing factors, however the solution is simple. [CRI] will provide over 40 years of combined credit restoration experience compiled with state of the art software we will help almost anyone reinvent and improve their credit score and rating. The result is hundreds and thousands of dollars in savings and lower interest rate loans, while giving CRI customer’s competitive edge in the employment market. The key to successful credit restoration is not only understanding the applicable laws but how they are used in the scoring model. After spending over a combined 40 years in the mortgage, finance and related industry, the principals of CRI understand and have a passion to help people reinvent themselves and improve their financial health. Years have been spent turning the consumer down for home, auto, household’s goods and other basic necessities. Now it is time for [CRI] to use their skills, knowledge, relationships and experience to Re-Invent the consumer.

"US1000002203","SRN, Inc","Business Summary: SRN is the creator of a patent-pending incident barrier system called the SRN 1000. Within the law enforcement community, which spends over 100 billion annually, there is no efficient method to decrease ‘rubbernecking’ and ensure privacy from public view. The SRN 1000 is the first barrier of its kind that is durable yet light-weight and able to be set up by one person and break down into a small compartment. The SRN 1000 allows first responders or other law enforcement personnel to quickly and easily obstruct the view of onlookers during traffic accidents, crime scenes, or other sensitive matters such as vehicle searches. 

Customer Problem: Having and maintaining privacy and safety is a growing concern. Albeit traffic accidents, searches, crime scenes, deaths, film making, emergency management, crowd control, or disaster areas. An escalating lack of privacy for sensitive incidents creates strain and undue criticism on law enforcement personnel to conduct operations. In addition, rubbernecking from traffic accidents causes hours of delays, congestion, and consequent accidents.

Target Market: Law Enforcement – highway patrol, local & state police, crime scene units; Federal government – FEMA, DHS, DoD; emergency responders, news & media, entertainment, airports, hotels, schools, and sporting stadiums.

Sales & Marketing Strategy: Focused effort within law enforcement industry. Strategy includes direct sales, brand awareness, conferences & trade shows, and an intense development of resellers and distributors. 

Gross margins range from 30-55% based on the type of sales channel and quantity purchased. 

Use of Funds: There are three main uses for capital: 1) increase inventory to keep up with demand, 2) fuel sales & marketing efforts, 3) execute next stage growth efforts.

Competitive Advantage: Our products are proprietary, in large demand due to growing concerns, and cater to numerous market segments.

"US1000002209","Capital Esquire LLC","There are several important distinctions between the approach of the traditional hard money lender and the vision of this company.  First, we provide a cheaper source of credit, which is justified by a different level of underwriting.  While traditional hard money lenders base credit decisions on the asset alone, we focus on the track record of the developer as well.  Only experienced operators receive funds, not just any novice investor who happens across an attractive deal.  Good borrowers, even when they encounter challenges with completing and/or liquidating their project, have planned alternatives and additional resources that can assist them in fulfilling their financial obligations.  This difference alone can make the difference between profitable and unprofitable long-term investment.  

Next, we have a holistic approach toward lending that comes from wearing many different hats.  We have been on all sides of the transaction, from title to real estate brokerage to rehab investor to negotiator/facilitator/wholesaler.  This diverse perspective allows us to understand the various roles, needs and challenges of each of the players involved, to better structure deals and to anticipate and address competing concerns of the parties involved.  While many lenders aggressively seek to nickel and dime borrowers and even maliciously foreclose in order to obtain the underlying asset (their covert goal even when making the loan), we believe in cultivating long-term relationships based on trust and partnership. If we wish to maintain long-standing relationships and continue in business, one-time transactions that unwind with alienated parties is not the way to do it.  Furthermore, the reality is that these deals and real estate in general rarely go as planned, and parties must make allowance for imperfection.  We recognize this fact, and have the infrastructure and connections in place to nimbly propose alternatives to adjust accordingly.

After 3 years of research we have discovered that the fastest growing demographic is in the west valley of Phoenix where there are no nightclubs other than strip clubs for people to go after a tough week of work and let their hair down. We have also discovered that people want to dance, love rock and roll music, and have a great desire for high quality service in a club atmosphere that is both upbeat and classy. With the stresses of todays society people have a need to spend time relaxing and not have to worry about their problems. Currently we have everything in place to be able to open our doors in a 60 to 90 day window but in order to adequately fund this project it will take $750,000.00 of initial investment (to open the doors) with a total investment of $1.8 to $2.0 million in order to carry us through the first 2 to 3 years of operation in order to build our brand and customer base. Our demographics of this area shows that across 12 zip codes ranging from west of the I-17 to east of the Loop 101 the average income of 50% of the population earns an annual income of between $25k and $75k. This demographic fits right in with our desired customer base which is age 25 to 45 with an annual income of around $30k. By providing what our research shows the customers want (which they are not currently getting) we will be able to establish Drakk's Place as THE place to go on the west side. There is much more to reveal at a later date that will further establish the west side of Phoenix as a major entertainment center and not just another patch of farmland populated by cowboys and beer bars.

"US1000002217","Natural Restoration Partners","Natural Restoration Partners, LP has developed in cooperation with partner entities, a fully permitted gold ore milling site in a rich historic mining district of Colorado which has an abundant supply of ore dumps from previous mining activity. This cast off ore from long ago mining activity contains gold content that is profitable to mill at current prices. NRP owns 50% of the mill operation and has secured 70 patented mining claims with over 250,000 tons of ""dump ore"" and over 1.2 million oz of conservatively estimated underground reserves. Funds raised will be used to build a 400 ton/day mill, get into full production processing ore dumps and to continue acquiring strategic gold properties in the district. We have built two pilot mills to prove the concept and have had extensive testing conducted by multiple independent assay firms to validate the level of gold content in the head ore and the concentrate we produce. In addition to the properties we already control, 2 -3 million tons of dump ore remain available in the district at relatively cheap acquisition prices because there is no mill in the region. This mining district is an EPA designated ""superfund"" site because of the toxic metals leaching out of the dump piles throughout the watershed which provides drinking water supply to much of Denver. Local governments have spent millions of dollars on water treatment. Our process effectively cleans up the toxic ore dumps by milling the ore into concentrate that is shipped to the smelter. The tailings from the milling process are detoxified. The process is a profitable way to solve a major environmental problem at no cost to taxpayers. The project is profitable with gold prices above $750/oz. At current gold prices above $1200 per ounce, there is conservatively $85 in gold per ton of dump ore and our all-in cost/ton is $56. This gives us an excellent 34% profit margin which will increase significantly as the price of gold rises further.","EquityNet","Materials","Basic Resources","Metals & Minerals","Atlanta","GA","US","http://www.equitynet.com/c/natural-restoration-partners","http://www.equitynet.com/c/natural-restoration-partners","Equity","Active","2014-11-04 13:20:30","2014-11-04 13:20:30","FALSE","1.2E7","143000.00","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"US200000221B","Haunted Ozarks"," 	Haunted Ozarks was started in 2010 as a haunted attraction unlike anything in our area.  Using Hollywood level sets and expertly trained actors, Haunted Ozarks quickly became one of the top haunted attractions in the Branson/Springfield area in the first year.  Awarded the 2nd best haunted attraction in the Oklahoma/Missouri/Texas area in 2011, Haunted Ozarks soon became a destination for tourists from as far away as Illinois and Colorado.  We have a dedicated fan base with over 3,000 likes on our Facebook page and visitors posting rave reviews.  What makes Haunted Ozarks unique is our dedication to never giving our audience the same product every year.  We have changed our maze layout and design from year to year which gives our returning customers something new every season they visit.   Two of our partners are screenwriters with numerous options, so we are always striving to deliver Hollywood style thrills to our patrons.  In 2013 we partnered with Fox Television and created an attraction showcasing their new show ""Sleepy Hollow"" and helped them promote the show's debut season.   Haunted Ozarks is also dedicated to being involved in the community and local charities.  We particularly enjoy assisting charities that aid children and teenagers since these are our primary customer base.  We have donated tickets to the Boys and Girls club, as well as Big Brothers and Sisters.  We have also held food drives for Christian Action Ministries and held dedicated non scary trick or treating nights for smaller children.  We also offer military discounts and have dedicated nights for veterans and their families.   Owners Joe Blackerby, Lewis Holleman and Grant Smith are all dedicated to their families and include them in this community event that has entertained thousands over the last 4 years.

"US100000221C","Shop On Main, LLC"," 	We have a big dream, the biggest vision we've ever had.   	For a Small Business: Imagine a place where businesses from all over could showcase products and services in a way that wasn't just about the lowest price. Where pride and craftsmanship made a difference. Where the unique flavors of every business was allowed to shine – just like it does when walking down a city Main Street.   	Where you could grow your business by building a loyal customer base that could be next door, or on the other side of the country.   	For Shoppers: Imagine a website that made online shopping nearly as fun as real world shopping. Not just to compare prices, but to actually shop on. A place where you could get the feeling of walking down a real Main Street in any town, anywhere.   	Window shopping. Browsing. Feeling the thrill of discovering something you didn’t know you needed but just have to have.   	For an Investor: Let's remember about 40% of amazon's $70B  in sales last year came from 3rd party small businesses participating on the amazon web site.  But amazon doesn't share any customer information with the merchant, in fact they hide the merchant from the shopper.  How can you build a business this way?   	But what other option do the 3 million or so small businesses on amazon have?   	We have begun by creating a place where small businesses will be celebrated.  By joining together on ShopOnMain.com we can share shipping volume across 100s of businesses to negotiate rates with shippers.  Where we can use internet marketing across 100s of businesses to drive traffic in a way that is much more cost effective.

The Company’s product pipeline includes Fe3C compounds for the prevention of foodborne illnesses, and the treatment of bacterial infections including infected chronic wounds and medical devices. Each year in the US, it is estimated that there are about 3.2 million cases of foodborne illness due to bacteria, 2 million nosocomial (hospital acquired) infections, and that up to 6% of implanted medical devices become infected. The cost of treating foodborne bacterial infections is estimated to be $9 billion. The cost of treating hospital-acquired infections is now a staggering $30 billion.   	 Akeso’s lead Fe3C product is a feed additive designed to prevent food poisoning by Campylobacter, a bacteria that causes diarrhea, abdominal cramps, fever and vomiting for up to 6 days. The infection can also lead to irritable bowel syndrome, reactive arthritis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and can even be deadly for some patients. The bacterium is commonly transmitted to humans from poultry, lives in the intestines of chickens, and after factory processing is a common contaminate found on about 65% of chickens sold by grocery stores. In the EU, Campylobacter causes more cases of foodborne illness than Salmonella, E. coli and Listeria combined with an estimated 280,000 cases in the UK and 9 million in the EU.   	 Akeso’s product pipeline is evolving to include the use of the Fe3C technology to prevent the formation of bacterial biofilms on medical devices, and to treat biofilm infections. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), biofilms account for over 80% of microbial infection in the body, and are estimated to account for almost 50% of the 2 million hospital-acquired infections.

"US1000002286","Target Business Capital LLC","Small business lending is a explosive emerging market and one of the fastest-growing industries today. The industry provides the ability to achieve very large profits with a quick turn to profitability. 2014 is projected to produce $8.8 billion in small business loans with an increase to $870 billion of funded loans by 2025 which equates to a stellar 258% year-over-year increased growth rate.

Small Business loans are small short term loans with a 3 to 6 month duration to solve an immediate cash need for the business owners. Fees and loan rates can range from 3% to 5% per month with a 1% to 2.5% origination fee.

Loan application is a simple 10 minute process. Target Business Capital(TBC) can connect small businesses with non traditional funding products in 24 hours or less. Loan are similar to prime credit and loan amounts will range from $5,000 to $100,000. Payments on the loan will be automatically debited directly from the customers bank account. Loans are generally collateralized by a personal guarantee or UCC filing.

Currently 92% of all small businesses are unable to borrow money. Small businesses struggle with cash flow needs and lack the necessary cash to make investments to further grow their business. Seeking capital from a traditional bank is nearly nonexistent.

TBC is not a newcomer to the online lending industry. The ownership and management team have 8 years of online lending experience.
A huge differentiating factor for TBC is that it holds ownership to its own proprietary loan processing software and lead generation technology that is currently in operation. This alone lowers operational cost and adds in credible intrinsic value to TBC upon sale of the company.

"US1000002290","Avivid Water Technology, LLC"," 	 Avivid Water is wholly owned by Avivid Technologies Group, LLC and is  dedicated to preserving and enhancing the world’s water resources by offering a novel solution to cleaning contaminated water. Avivid Water applies its patented TurboCoag©  process to the known technology of electrocoagulation (EC). EC systems work by passing contaminated liquids over electrically charged plates creating a reaction, which causes the contaminants to be precipitated out in solid sludge form. Avivid Water has solved difficulties with passivization which will now allow EC to become the system of choice to treat waters with emulsified oils, poorly settling solids and poorly soluble organics that add turbidity, odor and color to water. EC is highly effective for removing arsenic, heavy metals, and soluble organic compounds. Microorganisms are killed in the process of EC treatment. Special applications such as arsenic removal, latex paint extraction and polymer cleanup, coal/sulfur/clay/water separation, and environmental remediation projects are ideally suitable for TurboCoag© . Avivid Water’s system is best described as a combination of a pumping system, integrated with an innovative self-cleaning cell that coagulates suspended material, reacts with contaminates, kills microbes and precipitates a sludge containing these contents. In addition to its self-cleaning features, the system increases current density through the fluid and allows for a smaller reactor for any given volume of water. The design is optimized for servicing of the reactor in the field and can be scaled to treat high volumes of water on a continuous basis. The patent for this product was awarded in April 2013. Avivid Water’s TurboCoag©  has achieved a revolutionary improvement over prior EC technologies but maintains common features of EC which are:  •Dramatically lowering the costs of waste processing for many contaminants •Creating less non-toxic sludge that is suitable for landfill by using no chemicals ","EquityNet","Commerce & Industry","Sanitation","Waste Management & Recycling","Longmont","CO","US","http://www.avividwater.com","http://www.equitynet.com/c/avivid-water-technology-llc","Convertible Debt","Active","2014-11-18 21:59:56","2014-11-18 21:59:56","FALSE","5000000.0","475000.00","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our marketing strategy will be to initiate a new technology that has proven to be very successful in the auto warranty arena called agent assisted automation. This patented technology is specifically designed to mask foreign agents so they can prospect for sales  leads without any productivity loss. It is no secret that prospects do not like to hear sales pitches delivered by a foreigner. When lead generation is performed with an international accent, there is an 80% conversion loss that negates the benefit of using cheap offshore labor.

The Virtual Engagement and Data Analytic System – an interactive live support application hosted on Google Glass (and other devices) was conceived and developed to solve the very specific needs of healthcare facilities &amp; industry suppliers. As equipment, implants, and surgical tools evolved to do more, most of them have also become more complex.   	Perioperative support for these implants and instruments is further complicated by changing regulations and new industry-wide policies which control and limit the interactions of suppliers and healthcare providers.   	A critical issue for manufacturers and suppliers is adapting to industry efforts focused on reducing supplier traffic in operative areas. These changes have made on-site supplier support more difficult, and squarely place the additional burden on doctors, nurses and management.   	 Remote Reps has designed a Virtual Engagement System that is hosted on Google Glass, and other wearable and mobile devices. The proprietary features not only solve the critical market problem of medical device/technology case coverage in a changing healthcare environment, but delivers added value in other business operations. By providing smart, big data analytics on case coverage instances Remote Reps can revolutionize the way suppliers and facilities view surgical case support.   	That potential to provide big data analytics, automated billing and tracking services and best practices consulting is made possible by using our Virtual Engagement System on Google Glass or other hardware.

"US30000022DD","Quit Smoking 24/7","The simple truth: the industry standard for smoking cessation products has at a dismal 93% failure rate.  The fact is the products out there don't work on their own.  Why, ask any smoker, smoking is a mental addiction not a physical one.  All the products out there aim to solve the physical addiction. QS 24/7 is the first product ever to end addiction.

Let's get scientific, a mental addiction doesn't mean made up.  It means the neurons in your brain have been trained to fire dopamine into the system.  The result is an intense and unrelenting desire for nicotine so long as the neurons continue to fire.  So, it's in the brain but the addiction is the result of chemical reactions.  

Throwing on a patch or chewing some gum won't stop the neurons from firing,...ever.  QS 24/7 is is the first complete Standardized Behavioral Support System using scientifically verified techniques that end the cravings.

Pharma seeks products like QS 24/7 to give their products a competitive advantage.  Our primary aim is to exit to pharma with a very lean business model that requires no marketing or support staff. < 1.5 years with a $20M-$100M acquisition.  To do this we are enhancing our system to benefit NRT manufacturers. 

 Behavioral support typically means 1-on-1 therapy sessions.  Pharma can't profit from this form of therapy, but they can profit from selling QS 24/7 along with their existing lines.

NRTs are a instant fix but not permanent
Behavioral Support is a permanent fix but not instant
Together we have created the most effective smoking cessation solution ever.

This will give one NRT manufacturer a clear competitive advantage in the $3B industry.  We have identified 4 primary targets: GSK, Pfizer, RJ Reynolds and CVS.  We will offer our program to each one of them increasing the likelihood of a competitive offer.

We will also test our product efficacy w/o NRTs.

From there, DS provides a platform from which you can be as general or as selective as you'd like in order to build your own exclusive dating experience – no matter what your preferences may be. Instead of publicizing your dating criteria for the entire dating community to see, we program the application in a way that all members outside of network never even see you – period.   	Your time is scarce and therefore precious, you shouldn't have to waste it sifting through profiles of people that you would not consider dating.

Microwave and infrared, the frequencies that border these frequencies have led to multi-billion dollar industries.   	Often referred to as the “Terahertz Gap,” the technology has not been brought to commercialization due to the absence of compact sources and amplifiers capable of generating sufficient power.  THz is a platform technology that will open many market opportunities.   	Teraphysics recently achieved a revolutionary advancement:  The first suite of commercially viable high frequency devices capable of generating and amplifying power levels previously unattainable from solid state and laser enabled sources.  Our revolutionary devices are the most powerful hand-held THz and MMW devices in existence. Teraphysics is the sole owner of the critical proprietary technology that bridges the “THz Gap”.   	The initial target markets for Teraphysics is food processing and safety and wireless communications. THz’s unique ability to detect micro contaminants or foreign materials in a variety of different foodstuffs has led to a number of customer-driven, high value applications in food safety and processing. Teraphysics' MMW technology provides the wireless industry with a killer E-band solution for backhaul and the daunting data transmission demands the wireless industry is faced with.   	With these technologies, Teraphysics is closely collaborating with global leaders in multiple market verticals in the development and sale of THz and MMW products and applications. With its technology and key commercial relationships, Teraphysics’ goal is to create a vertically integrated entity that will dominate THz and MMW commercialization.

Two major forces have converged to create a fundamental shift and multi-million dollar opportunity in the US methanol market.  

•	Global demand for methanol in the last 5 years has grown by more than 45% to $32 billion in annual sales. Current and forecast Global demand for methanol is expected to grow another 70% over the next 6 to 7 years. 
•	Over the same period of time, US oil and gas producers have been so successful in the development of shale gas that the price of the feedstock in the production of methanol, natural gas, has dropped 65% and is not expected to increase significantly for decades.

US Methanol intends to enter the methanol production business with the acquisition, relocation, and modification of an existing 9,000 metric tons per year methanol production facility. Our plans include relocating the facility from Utah to natural gas rich Pennsylvania. Upon relocation and re-commissioning, the facility will commence production in the second half of 2015 and will be the only methanol producer in a $375 million Northeastern United States market.

With a population of over 59 million within 300 miles of US Methanol’s proposed production facility in Pennsylvania, the methanol market in the Northeastern US is a 750,000 metric tons per year market.  We intend to become “The Methanol Kings of the NE”.

Our management team has founded or co-founder numerous successful startups in technology and oil and natural gas. Between them they have taken public or managed 6 public companies and raised over $950 million.

We will sell a wide variety of vape products accessories, repair and a menu of e-liquids to customers including medium- and high-income residents of Maryland and local communities.

Binky's Vapes, LLC is established as a limited liability company owned by its founder. The store will be managed and directed by me, Beatrice Foster, a Army veteran in logistics and program manager with over 20 years' experience in customer service, inventory and product management in the private, military and government sectors.  I will be joined by husband as partner when the second store is opened.  I will serve many roles until we expand.

My husband and I understand we will constantly fight the stigma of being a ""head shop,""  and plan to educate our communities. We will provide one-on-one and group sessions in the store to teach e-cigarette users and hobbyists about the products.

I started my eBay business and soon realized I could make a bigger impact and reach more customers through retailing my products of choice.  As a previous smoker my husband found vaping and electronic cigarettes an excellent alternative.  He and I both have tried cold turkey, patches diet and exercise changes but continued to smoke.  He achieved success with quitting smoking much sooner than I.  We would travel 30-45 minutes to get the vaping products he needed, hence the idea of opening a store closer to our community.

We continue to operate via eBay until we have solidified funding and a location that suites our needs and the community we will serve. eBay has changed what is allowed so our personal site is in the making. We will provide e-cigarette, e-liquids, batteries, associated repair parts and products for our customers.

In the beginning the retail store will be operated by myself and two local employees. Eventually my husband will join the team as we open more stores in MD.

The application is divided into 2 types of events, private and public events. This platform allows broadcasters to advertise their events via social networks such us Twitter and Facebook , also, it is integrated with Twilio to send SMS messages worldwide.  

This idea was born out of necessity, since there are so many family and friend events in other states and overseas, that I am not able to attend, because of time constrains. Watching in  youtube, is not the same as enjoy the moment while it happens.

In order to broadcast a private event, an user would sign up, publish his event in a social network (optional), invite people via email, send SMS to mobile number, with a preset date and time. The invitees will get the invitation via SMS (optional) and email. Once the event is ready to be broadcasted, the broadcaster will open up youkaster app on their mobile phones and broadcast  away their events.  For a public event, the process is similar without the SMS portion and email invitation, this process is similar to eventbrite. 

I own 100% of  DevOpstier Inc, the company behind Youkaster, so far I have spend about $25K in developing the application, I have DevOps/Systems Engineering  background. We would monetize by charging per event attendee and per SMS message less than 7dollars per attendee, and a percentage 

I am looking to raise capital to finish up the development, hire full time developers, lease services to broadcast, testing  and for marketing. 

I firmly believe that this is the next wave of technologies, the average person can use the platform to make money, it can also serve to broadcast events such us Jingle Ball to the entire world, since anyone would be able to sign up and watch it live.

I started this business in June of 2014. The startup went as planned, however I need capital to fund the growth of this small business. The funds would pay for a used trash truck, advertising, trash cans, and a few more miscellaneous expenses.  On a personal note, I am 18 years old and was born on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. Finding funding for this business is very tough at my age. Although debt financing is preferred, I am open to other funding types as well. Please if you have any more questions do not hesitate to contact me. I can be reached by cell phone at 410-829-1299, or email me at johnsoncasey16@gmail.com.

(a management consulting firm/government contractor), Nevada Partners, Inc., and Lockheed Martin, which created a public-private partnership, namely UAS Recruit (UASRecruit.com). Our objectives are multifold: to help business commercialize UAS; to create jobs across the United States; to create UAS for the commercial market and work with both the military/commercial industry to create new technologies.   	With the FAA investing $100 Billion dollars at the UAS market to create a new industry and hundred of thousands of new jobs, we have taken a macro-approach to targeted objective to maximize results. It is our belief that it takes good and actionable information to make any business stand out and the foundation of such information is quality and timely data. UAS Recruit, a public-private partnership, was founded with these principles in mind.   	Corpnet has built a team of partnerships and alliances with some of the leaders in scientific research, workforce development, as well as drone manufacturing and robotics developers in the industry.  Corpnet is working with 432d Wing Creech AF Base Nevada, Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton, Lockheed Martin, Desert Research Institute (DRI), Doctor Paul Oh of Drexel University/UNLV and NIAS-UAS to accomplish our endeavors. Goals of this unsolicited government proposal are to  underscore the potential rewards which include, but are not limited to the following: best price accommodations, the highest caliber consulting and business expertise spearheading efforts to fruition, re-infusing public trust and the entrepreneurial spirit – which is the backbone of industrialism in America. Our proposal to help the government by more effectively spearheading the commercialization of the UAS and its related efforts translates to a win-win.   	One of our goals is to do an IPO in the next few years.

"US2000002371","Sleeping On Air"," 	Retailing is not dead! The Mattress business is thriving and is mostly recession proof, and is a business that still depends mostly on brick and mortar locations to be successful: The first, most-important thing to know about a mattress is, Do you like how it feels?   	This year, one Mattress Retailer of Specialty Beds will top a billion dollars in revenue with no significant competition. If you want this unique mattress technology--this billion dollar technology--for all practical purposes,  you have only one place to go. More than 90% of this company's sales come from their Retail Stores.   	In the Portland, OR area, there are four stores in a fairly tight geographic region. These four stores should produce in excess of ten million dollars in revenue. (All figures and estimates taken from quarterly SEC filings). This market is ripe for one or two strong, properly-focused competing stores; DIRECT COMPETITORS, not conventional Mattress Stores that sell ""ordinary"" brands and products, or who merely dip their toe in with one or two ""me too"" products. That will be Sleeping On Air.   	This company sells an excellent, high profit-margin product, but there are  a few places where their business model is lacking. For example, dictated prices means no price negotiation, making them vulnerable to price competition from savvy, similar-product competitor. And all their mattresses are made-to-order; it takes up to two-weeks to get a bed. This makes them vulnerable to an In-stock, fast-delivery competitor.  They are also weak on after-the-sale service. A more nimble competitor could out-perform them easily, making unhappy customers very impressed with your service.   	This is a fantastic opportunity, with a realistic chance to grab 15% of the local market share in the first year, by providing comparable quality both faster and cheaper.The goal is to open one Sleeping On Air Store first, with a second location in 9-12 months. Recouping total investment in 12-18 months is very realistic.

"US1000002374","JobFinder.Ninja"," 	You've seen it before - you go to a freelance website and bid on a project.  It cost you some money, but that's okay, because you're confident that your skill and proposal will get you the bid.  A couple days later, your bid isn't chosen, because someone else who is far less qualified got the job just because they can undercut your price.   	Thought:  What if you had to pay for every bid you placed?  That would reduce the amount of SPAM bidders who bid on every project.  But what about the cost to you?  You've ALSO seen websites where you do have to bid on projects.  Sure it makes for a quality control, but 10 bids later at a crazy amount of money per bid, you're broke and didn't get a single job.  Solution:  You have to pay for a bid, but if you don't win the job, you get your money back.  Doesn't that seem simple?  IT IS!   	What we do:  You get charged a small monthly membership, at which point you are entitled to make a certain amount of bids as part of your membership.  If you don't win a project, you get refunded the bid cost.  If you win the project, you don't get your bid money back.  Do you have a job you want to post?  For the same monthly membership, you can post a certain amount of projects every month.   	How do we make money on this:  Once the project poster selects a winning bidder (not always the highest or lowest, but the best proposal), we take a small percentage of the final agreed upon price.   	Why does this work:  Your project is posted with the rest after being carefully looked over to make sure it meets standards and quality control.  Then our group of prospective freelancers, whom we have already qualified and verified as authentic job seekers, bid on your project.  Detailed proposals are given, and a price is set which they believe they can fulfill your project needs.   	Everyone is qualified and verified before they are even added to the system, project posters and freelancers alike.

Our flagship product is Stargate©, an AI-Driven Social Networking platform. Think Facebook meets 2001--A Space Odyssey.

This adjustable-width chassis allows the excavator to access a 36 inch wide backyard gate or 36"" door and then expand to twice it's width for stability and operator safety. 
 
Our Model 34 is in the industry standard ""Compact-class"" which is a contractor's ""production"" unit. That means it has a digging depth of over 8 feet and is powered by a 36 HP diesel engine. Once in the confined space (such as a backyard or building) the contractor has the ability to dig basements, foundations, swimming pools, trenches, septic fields, etc. It also has the axillary hydraulic power for augers, impact hammers, etc. The tracked undercarriage has the same load-bearing capacity regardless of track width and the width can be adjusted while the unit is in motion or while stationary if on loose soil. Our production unit will have a tilt function so vertical trenches can be excavated while the unit is on a cross-slope. 

Demand: 100K/yr. USA - 300K/yr. globally 

Investment purpose: (1) Purchase a new compact excavator and modify the width (narrow by about 5""); (2) Mate the upper portion of the excavator to our adjustable-width articulating undercarriage; (3) Use this production ""Model 34""  to market in NM & AZ and secure purchase orders and ""second round"" investors; (4) arrange for contract equipment manufacturing. As a side note the Navajo Nation had told us sometime back that they would purchase 120 units, one for each of the Chapter Houses (local governing jurisdiction) on their reservation.

Gaither had issue that was had been nagging him for years. Whenever he saw an injured player due to a concussion, he wondered if he could improve upon the performance of the equipment. Gaither was far from becoming an expert in brain injuries and had no background in engineering. Eventually he studied helmets and came up with a conclusion that focused on design and performance. From that study, Gaither had idea that could change football forever. He invented Hard Knox Impact Pads.         Langston Gaither knew that Hard Knox Impact Pads were long overdue and needed to be on football field every day. Hard Knox is a major improvement to football helmets as we know them. There has never been a product that has impacted football the way Hard Knox does. But there's only one problem.....Gaither Design Company needs the capital to get Hard Knox to the market.

"US10000023D0","BarkingSeals.com"," 	We have created an incredibly powerful online auction platform, infused it with robust social media capabilities and based on the needs of companies to liquidate underutilized assets or non performing inventory. Online auctions have removed the fun of going to actual auctions, the interactions between the bidders, the ability for the auctioneer to increase the interest in the lot by interacting with the bidders and encouraging participation by the bidders.  Anyone that has been to an auction and has bid online will note the drastic differences between an online auction and a live auction.  Granted, you can attend an online auction from anywhere, but that is where the benefits stop.   Our Platform: Puts the social interaction between the bidders and the auctioneer back into the online auction platforms, allowing bidders to get the best of both worlds.  They will have the interaction of a real auction and, at the same time, attend the auction from anywhere in the world.    Business model is focused on larger items that tend to have bidders within a 100 mile radius.   Our software is designed to act and respond like a live auction house.    Additionally, we have two very unique bidder tools.  The first is our auction block which reflects all items in any auction the bidder is registered in that have less than 3 minutes to close. These items will all be shown on one easy to read page.   The second tool we have in place is live social interaction (Real Time Chat) between bidders and the sellers (Auctioneers).  We encourage the seller to participate by adding color commentary to the items when they can.    The seller only needs to create the event for the actual auction event and the bidders will be able to go to that auction event and see all of the items in the auction.    Through the use of Geographic Licensee, we will be establishing local brand ambassadors that operate their own business through the use of our software platform.

"US10000023D3","Senior Farms"," 	The concept is simple, seniors (people 65 years and older) want to retire and live in a desirable retirement area of the country, but many if not most have not planned and saved enough money to accomplish their goals. Many are left with having to supplement their finances through part time jobs, and now have to live in the metro areas where these part time jobs are available. The desirable retirement areas just can not support the part time jobs these senior need so they are stuck living and working in the metro areas of the country. My concept allows senior to live and work in the desirable retirement areas of the country.  They also get to work part time in a climate controlled state of the art commercial greenhouse, doing harvesting and planting jobs that are enjoyable and easy for the senior to accomplish. They only have to commit to 15-20 hours per week which is only 2-3 days per week and also have 3 months a year off for vacations and holidays. We also provide affordable beautiful homes for them to lease / own near the greenhouse where they can walk to work. Over the years I have spoken with thousands of seniors about this concept and most love this idea and are ready for its development as well.   	I need investors to help with long and short term monies.  I need 30 million in short term construction loans to build the 150 homes.  This construction loan will be paid back with interest in 10-12 months.  The net profit from the sale of the homes will be 1.5 million which wil be used as working capitol for the greenhouse.  I need 6 million in long term money for the construction of the commerical greenhouse. Gross profits from the sales of produce each year is estimated at 8 million per year with net profits after debt service of 1.5 million per year.

"US10000023D6","To Soil Less","To Soil Less is an alternative agriculture company that specializes in a new form of gardening called gravel gardening or geological agriculture, the study of using rocks to grow and cultivate crops absent of soil and fertilizers. This new science, invented by To Soil Less founder Richard Campbell, operates under the fundamental equation of water + river rock = plant food, referred to as the Campbell Equation.  With gravel gardening, the rules of gardening differ drastically compared to all known types of gardening and agricultural processes. The benefits of gravel gardening are: 1) No soil use; 2) No fertilizer use; 3) Low water needs; 4) Low cost to consumers; 5) Minimal weeding; 6) Fresh tasting food quality; 7)Durable and long lasting; 8) Sustainable both indoors and outdoors; 9) Scalable and 10) Helps address food security issues globally.  The are an estimated 9 sub industries of gravel gardening from decades of academic research with universities to  use in the design of green roofs and balconies to retailing gravel grow cups for the home window sills or in the classroom as an experiment for students K-12.  Gravel also can help feed the homeless and poor, providing a permanent source of several types of produce using very little water.  Overseas, gravel gardening can enable those in places with poor soil quality to enjoy the benefits of sustainable gardening, providing their families with year round access to produce at home.  To Soil Less partners include George Washington University who helps study the geological side of the science, while Tennessee State University's Department of Agriculture studies the agricultural effect of gravel gardening.  The Washington, DC area Ace Hardware is the primary retail partner as Ace  retails the best gravel tested to date by To Soil Less.  There are several media interviews in the market, from in-studio TV news interviews to blogger reviews to press releases that have been picked up in over 200 news outlets.

"US30000023DA","Gideen","
Gideen is a tech company which helps up to 900 million music makers worldwide to monetize their music by creating a new secondary market, where non-hit music can be traded as commodity for professional music use in videos, film, etc. a 65 bln $ opportunity.
Gideen acquires a 50% equity ownership of up to 600 million contract free songs with revenues of less than 10$/year and no market to go.
After optimizing financial performance and value of these assets through proprietary technology, innovative business models and by leveraging existing infrastructure from our Parasongs sister companies in Germany, Japan, Australia and the US, seasoned assets can be sold in aggregated song catalogs back to institutional investors as financially rated annuity producer for 10 to 15times yearly revenues. 

Within 5 month of public Beta, we have already increased average song value from less than 2$ at the time the asset was uploaded to Gideen's platform to 256$, = +12,700%, recording only 1 of up to 14 different revenue streams related to each asset.
Industry specific, international income is time delayed up to 3 years, which will bring already generated average asset value from 256$ to approx. 2,000$/asset over time, leading to a catalog sales value of 1 bln $ after 500,000 songs are uploaded.

Our business plan assumption is 5 million songs will be uploaded within 4 years = 0.8% of a new, completely untapped market, that's 600 million songs no one is competing and has a solution for, because with the traditional industry model, handling costs are higher than revenues.

Acquisition costs of a 50% equity ownership on these IP assets are our operational costs only. 
The business is fully scalable and running 500k , 5 million or 50 million assets don't make a significant difference besides costs for servers and some tech infrastructure.

The recent financing round projects IRR's of 700%, based on only 0.8% market share within 48 months of operation as a first market mover.

This investment is about ""green"" technology and recycled materials that pays environmental benefits. Skylar Energy Systems is committed to manufacture our units in the USA so that the jobs stay in this country. Please seriously consider this investment. 

Our energy system makes it possible to be ""grid independent"" and save money on electricity bills. As you may know the utility companies want you to be forever tied to their ""cash cow"" meter. This is of course self-serving and comes at a high environmental cost.

Our system is on the cutting edge of innovation that can be applied to the construction of homes regardless of climate. In fact, the hotter the climate the more effectively this system works. Why? The answer is simple - energy is concurrently saved as useable thermal energy at the temperate extremes. And the energy comes from the Sun. 

The Skylar Energy System consists of (1) an enclosure cabinet measuring 6 foot x 10 foot x 7 foot tall; (2) a steel mast that penetrates the roof and has photovoltaic solar panels and flat plate hot water collector panels; (3) a computer-controlled AC power inverter for 110/220 volt usage; (4) a rechargeable deep cycle battery bank; (5) a heat pump (like a refrigerator) to chill water; (6) a bio-diesel back-up generator; (7) two 600 gallon insulated water tanks and (8) a top-mounted HVAC fan unit for refrigerated air cooling and hot water heating.

Because this is the built-in HVAC unit the costs can be included in the mortgage and paid for accordingly with the mortgage tax advantages and solar credits.

"US1000002412","AmeriFlare Flare Gas Recovery Systems Inc dba AmeriFlare Inc.","We developed a complete system that takes Associated gas (flare gas) from oil wells. We strip out the methane/ethane for on site generator fuel,  move the remaining chemicals (NGL's) to  tanks and transport the material. NGL's sell or $1 gallon approx.  Generators onsite provide power for the oil well and processor, onsite diesel generators are removed.  The NGL's pay for the cost of the system that can be leased or purchased. On larger wells the profits on the NGL's can be significant.

Complete mobile system, including redundant generators. processor, tanks, platforms, buildings, cabling etc. competitors only provide partial. System utilizes a patented non-refrigeration, non-JT, non-cryo system, does not use glycol or methanol.  Results in higher NGL yields, larger turn-down range, higher quality methane fuel and lower system costs.

Systems generate power and host a patented LNG output module to create LNG or CNG from unused methane in addition to NGL monetization. Near zero emissions possible today.

Our systems are tailored to the well volume and power needs.  Systems are duel fueled and redundant so that oil pumping can proceed virtually 100% of the time with little or no downtime.  These system work  at -40F so they can operate in remote heavy snow areas, on rough terrain and more.

Our systemization, mobility and completeness takes all the guess work out of recovering flare gas.  The operator still flares excess methane (very little), monetizes the flare gas instead of burning it to the environment and eliminates diesel fuel use.  95% of oil well pollution is eliminated including diesel generator pollution since the diesel are eliminated.  Cash flow increases dramatically.  clustered wells are especially profitable. 

We are 90 days away from completing a working demonstration plants.  seeking working well sites is CO, TX and ND.

Investors enjoy pre-defined 12 to 15% annual revenue royalties, paid quarterly for a pre-defined period of time or until a pre-defined amount is paid back. Investors do not have to wait for an exit to see returns and have lesser fear of investment loss.

Our approach to  commercial income producing  real estate investments are:
1. Buy right at acquisition-- we will not buy unless we can at minimum double its acquisition value. As such, we make money when we buy.
2) Potential to increase value via rehab or conversion--if there does not exist an opportunity to increase the property value in a relatively short amount of time,  that property does not meet our acquisition criteria. As such, we limit our risk exposure.
3) Ensure exit profits within 12 to 24 months-- we seek to return investments back to our investors within 12 to 24 months. Thus lowering investors' exposure. 
4) Pay revenue royalties almost immediately allowing investors to enjoy liquidity and reduce fear of loss of investments.

Medpro Properties Inc is made up of an experienced and very innovative team banding together to do things differently. From our acquisition criteria to our conversions to exit to hold for long term cash flow---we are not confined by the industry box. We have NO BOX! 

 We don't just fly, WE SOAR!

At acquisition, we add value, pay pre-defined revenue royalties in a pre-defined timeline and at exit,  sell to end buyers at cost savings that help them to retain their wealth. We deliver what our investors expect and deserve. We know we have what it takes to help you enjoy your success - all day, every day.

The result is easy, low cost adoption, and a “perpetual” revenue model based on usage fee for Summerhill.  This also solves the “bulk” of biomass problem and associated transportation issues Summerhill possesses the key to the symbiotic relationship between a deep understanding of the agricultural market and economic viability of powdered fuels in the biomass market.   	Safe and reliable. Waste and byproducts derived from materials such as Alfalfa, Cane, Citrus, Corn, Flax, Manure, Sewage, Sorghum, Switchgrass, and Wood can be leveraged to create storable fuel and energy. Powdered biomass can enhance efficiency of cellulose to ethanol and diodigester processes by using byproduct for heat recovery in operations. Further, it is well documented across many industries to be easily and safely transported. Efficiency: Summerhill methods recover high percentages of energy stored in biomass without use of complex fermentation processes, fertilizer, food crops, or cultivated land.  The Summerhill process is easily inserted in the farm/processor/storage hub model that is inherent to agriculture. While most economic commercialization timelines for cleantech and green technology are expected to be 15-20 years, investors, the U.S. government  and affiliates would like to see a reduced timeline of to three to five years.  Since Summerhill leverages existing assets and ways of doing business, the company is confident it can achieve commercialization with an attractive ROI on a three to five year schedule.   	Summerhill’s strategy is to focus its suite of solutions at each point in a mapped ecosystem, and integrate at every point of the supply chain via licensing, royalti ","EquityNet","Energy","Green/Clean Technology","Alternative Energy, Other","Ithaca","NY","US","http://www.summerhillbiomass.com","http://www.equitynet.com/c/summerhill-biomass-systems-inc","Equity","Active","2015-01-31 13:58:43","2015-01-31 13:58:43","TRUE","100000.0","250000.00","","","","","http://www.linkedin.com/company/summerhill-biomass-systems","http://www.facebook.com/?q=#/groups/1714322515375142/","","","http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kfat4nQPv8g","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Advertising spending in the US is estimated at $251,000,000,000 per year – and digital advertising is the newest and fastest growing segment.  According to reports, digital advertising spending has overtaken every form of advertising, except television – and by 2018 it is projected to exceed even that medium.   The IBM Institute for Business Value stated that “The next 5 years will hold more change for the advertising industry than the previous 50 did.”  And we are distinctively positioned in the digital signage space.

 With our unique screen placement, our form of advertising provides a business the ability to target their ads both demographically and geographically – something that is difficult to match through any other means.  Today people are out and about all the time, living their busy lives, making it even more difficult to reach them via traditional advertising media - and digital signage advertising has stopping power.  The OTX study determined that 63% of the people say digital signage catches their attention – more than any other medium.  And it is not just that it catches their attention – but numerous studies show that people find it more interesting, unique, entertaining, and less annoying.  More importantly, it has been shown that digital signage is more effective in driving people to action.  And our screens are designed to provide interactive capabilities with each of its riders.

Company profitability in less than 24months and then phenomenal growth rate and margin. Currently we have three lighting distributors/manufacturers waiting for certification & commercialization and a Hotel chain waiting to run a pilot program for its chain.

Current products offered in the lighting control industry are complicated to set up,  commission,  and/or maintain. In addition, no products can calculate & predict energy savings. Lighting customers have accepted that paid professional is required for installation, commissioning and setting up lighting. For all changes and modifications, a paid company representative will revisit the site to make changes.

Despite advances in energy preservation, no user use metrics are available for calculation of how much energy is being used or saved with new technology. EM&N8's LightValet solves all of these problems and more.

Lights can be commissioned with auto discovery to find lights that populate as individual icons on the iOS application for program grouping. Best yet, LightValet measures realtime energy usage, then reports back for current savings recordings by day, hour, week, or month.

"US1000002470","Advanced fPAT Imaging Inc.","A NEW NON-RADIATION BASED BREAST IMAGING PLATFORM  FOR EARLY BREAST CANCER DETECTION, addressing the growing dissatisfaction with mammography's diagnostic accuracy.

Advanced fPAT Imaging Inc. is commercializing the JBI-360, the first breast imaging device to incorporate Functional PhotoAcoustic Tomography (fPAT). Developed at the University of Florida, fPAT offers an imaging alternative that does not have the loss of diagnostic accuracy in dense breast tissue that mammography faces. Over 50% of the population have dense breast tissue and should not rely on mammography for breast cancer screening. The JBI-360 provides a comfortable imaging experience that does not require radiation, injections of contrast agents, or painful breast compression. 

AfPII's management team strongly feels that fPAT imaging will have the same impact that CT and MRI had on the diagnostic imaging community. The diagnostic imaging marketplace exceeds $32B in 2015 and will grow to over $49B by 2020. To enter this market, AfPII is soliciting a seed capital investment of $300,000 to $500,000. The Florida Institute for the Commercialization of Public Research will match this seed investment up to $300K. AfPII has developed an excellent set of documents that describe this new imaging technology and the potential for substantial returns that can be realized from a seed capital investment.  For additional information,  please contact Michael Addley, CEO, at mike@afpii.com or 954.338.4635.

Solar energy production can be a key factor in this balancing act but the land demand is very high.  Hydroponic greenhouse agriculture can be a great asset, but its energy requirements are high.  The ideal answer is a self-sufficient and sustainable greenhouse technology which eliminates the need for external energy sources.  

Brite Solar is a nano-materials company that  has developed a transparent  solar glass technology based on  Die Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSC) .  The first target market is greenhouse solar glass, which  enables  the greenhouse to generate electricity needed for sustaining the internal environment.  Using this solar glass, the greenhouse's carbon footprint is significantly reduced as its reliance on externally generated electricity is significantly  reduced or eliminated. This is a great value proposition for the greenhouse operator since it reduces the operating cost for the greenhouse by 28% which is currently the cost attributed to energy.
Brite's technology is based on nano-materials which are ink-jet printed on to glass panels, eliminating the expensive and complex  production facilities needed to produce traditional solar panels.

It was founded by industry professionals, who understand the frustrations businesses experience, when purchasing electricity and natural gas, 

Over the past decades, we have seen a monopoly in the energy industry, across the nation.  Many people and businesses have had no choice when it came to purchasing energy to fuel their businesses.  All they could do. was take the power from the provider in their area, and the high rates that came with it. Now, because of deregulation, the country is experiencing a revolution in the electrical transmission industry.

Newer companies providing energy, both electricity and natural gas, have entered the market. This has caused a shift in the positions of power within the industry and enabled businesses to accept the best value from theses new alternative energy suppliers.

Electricity and natural gas are commodities.  Their prices change daily with the market. This makes it challenging for most businesses, without professional energy procurement  managers, to obtain price comparisons from a variety of suppliers.  Prices must be compared on exactly the same day in order to get the best deal. In addition, the terms of the particular contract offered by the supplier influences the price that is quoted. A professional energy  consultant and broker, provides a valuable service to businesses, because they work with a large number of suppliers and can compile the  prices, terms and conditions, from sundry suppliers and offer the best solution to the client when purchasing energy for their enterprise.

"US10000024C2","Badger Innovative Technologies, LLC ","Badger Innovative Technologies has developed a new paper drywall tape called Wet N Ply, which consists of a unique process for wetting and applying drywall tape in the drywall installation process.   
Wet N Ply  was developed in conjunction with the input of contractors in the US and Canada.

Wet N Ply uses a water based adhesive, which adheres to the drywall, replacing the initial coat of joint compound in the first step of the drywall installation process, thereby cutting application time and materials by an average of 33%.  Development of a prototype and field testing have been successfully completed.

In conjunction with tape, Badger Innovative Technologies  has also developed a drywall taping tool, Tech Tool, which can replace the ""bazooka"", a drywall taping tool commonly used by contractors today.   The Tech Tool can be operated by lesser skilled labor, thereby reducing labor costs by at least 25%.  The Tech Tool is also lighter in weight and more mobile than the conventional bazooka.  Development of a prototype and field testing have been successfully completed.

Badger Innovative Technologies  will initially focus its attention on the residential, commercial construction, and renovation  markets.  We are partnering with an international distributor of building materials that is ready to take the products to markets in the US and Canada.  

We will also work with Mfg Reps, that had been set up previously, to service an established network of 450 dealers throughout the US and Canada.  Later the company will move into the Do It Yourself (DIY) markets in the US and Canada.   As brand recognition and traction is achieved in these markets, Innovative Tech will expand to other countries.

Both of these new products will be protected by patents issued in the US, Canada, and other countries throughout the world where drywalling is done.

The Barbeque Industry is a $4 billion dollar industry made up of mostly mom and pop's restaurants or large steak houses.
 
If you go to anywhere in the US and ask a local where they might find good barbeque, they will tell you some local mom and pop store. You will never hear them say a National Brand name recognized BBQ restaurant, Why? Because it does not exist!!
 
There are several BBQ franchise chains but they are so limited to what they do because for decades bbq has been specialized and regional, but I have created the first bbq concept that can go nationwide. How do I know this?? Because we have solved the BBQ industry's biggest problem and that is ""Regional taste"" No longer will you have to travel to Texas for Texas style BBQ or to the Carolinas for southern style BBQ because we will cover ALL regional taste. Instead of asking for the nearest BBQ joint, people will start to ask nationwide, ""Where's the nearest Diggers BBQ!""
 
After 10 years of long hard research I have created a concept  that will do for BBQ what Starbucks did for coffee. Coffee has been around for sometime now, but when Starbucks came along they took over and made it a monopoly and now when people think coffee they think Starbucks and that is what we want to do for Barbeque-""BRAND IT"".

"US10000024D2","Deb's Gourmet"," 	Deb's Gourmet has developed the first flavored pickled jalapeno pepper. We did a blind taste test through Fresno State University and 9 out of 10 people preferred our jalapeno peppers over the leading companies in the condiment industry such as Mezzetta, Giuliano's and Star Fine Foods. We have 2 flavors at this time and we are working on a third. Our first flavor is "" Sweet Smoky"". The taste is something that blows your mind. When you put it in your mouth the first thing you get is a sweet taste, then the hickory/chipotle flavor comes through then you get a taste of the jalapeno heat at the end. One of the unique qualities of this flavor is there is NO vinegar taste at all. When cooking with pickled jalapenos one of the reasons chefs don't use it as much is because of the strong vinegar taste that comes with it. Our peppers  don't have that taste so the diversity of the dishes that you could use these in is endless. Our second flavor is ""Simply Smoky"". There were a few people that loved the flavor of our ""Sweet Smoky"" but didn't like the sweet so we took the sugar out and tweaked our spices and Bam our second flavor. We only had the one flavor for 3 years then after introducing the ""Simply Smoky"" it took off and in the first year it has caught up with our Sweet Smoky and people are loving it. We are in over 250 locations in 6 states, around 70 restaurants and the Chukchansi Ball Park in Fresno, California through Ovations.

"US10000024E0","Insiders Sports, Inc.","We are a digital sports media company that creates original sports content for the web, mobile and broadcast. We have nearly two decades of experience in this space with a recognized staff and substantial audience. 

We currently have two verticals running in basketball and football with more verticals planned post funding to expand into baseball, hockey, lifestyle and potentially soccer.

We are open to discussion on investment structure for the right partner.

Frequently Asked Questions

What Makes Us Different?

Most of the sports content on the web today is one of two flavors – Major Media (ESPN) or fan-driven (Fan Blogs). We are neither. We have the relationships and reach of a major media company but the flexibility to feed the die-hard sports fan in ways that the major media simply doesn’t want to do or the that fan-driven content can’t do. We have deep relationships with players, coaches and executives and we leverage those relationships to tell bigger, deeper and more informed stories than our competition. We also leverage those relationships into exclusive content for the web, mobile and video. In a world of aggregated content, we are truly original content producers and Insiders in sports. That has made us popular among fans, and even more so among brand marketers.

Why Invest With Us?

The current investment landscape is ripe for content producers like us. Recent valuations for like-minded content companies have eclipsed the billion dollar mark. We are building a platform that should draw a sizable valuation once complete and should present many attractive options for early investors either to exit during a future funding round or to be part of a M&A deal down the road.

"US100000252D","InstaDab Inc"," 	InstaDab's rugged build and superior system design outperform its competitors. Concentrates are the fastest growing cannabis product. Invest in enails today.   	InstaDab Enail is a manufacturing company. The InstaDab Enail control box controls the temperature of the included dabbing surface (dome-less nail) to the set value, electronically. Most of the revenue will come from sales to wholesalers &amp; distributors who sell to our target demographic. There will be; myself, an engineer/manager, an administrative assistant, three assembly line workers and a salesperson. I have 8 years of experience in management positions and have owned and operated several successful small businesses.   	The InstaDab Enail eliminates the need for clumsy and potentially hard to use propane and butane torches to heat up ""nails"" when consuming ""dabs"" of cannabis concentrate. The InstaDab Enail eliminates the waiting time between ""dabs"" for the user(s) because it stays hot. It also allows the user to see what temperature the dabbing surface is at via a digital display while keeping the dome-less nail at a desired set temperature.   	InstaDab Enail precisely heats up and maintains the temperature of the consumer's dome-less nail at a set temperature. Therefore concentrates can be consumed at the lowest possible temperature. It's more efficient with less waste and more taste than using a torch. It stays at the set temperature so people can share, or pass around  the dabbing device. There is no work needed as opposed to using a torch, just flip a switch.   	InstaDab Enail is early into the enail market. It will have an industry leading warranty. In my experience there is a huge gap between supply and demand for these new devices and InstaDab will be there to fill it. When compared to its competitors, InstaDab uses a more rugged and durable heater that also has a unique look. The thermocouple temperature probe is much closer to the dabbing surface, meaning faster response and less concentrates used.

BEN is democratizing access to creditworthiness and other types of important business data. Why? SMBs struggle with nearly every aspect of business credit. The existing credit bureaus often fail to score SMBs accurately. Some small firms do not even show up in their databases. And since there is no affordable solution for business credit data, SMBs suffer huge write offs - $64 billion last year. 

BEN has solutions for each of these problems as discussed below. Our platform is an attractive alternative to the credit bureaus. BEN also offers powerful marketing and lead gen tools.

Now, with labs in 4 states (and at least two new locations opening in 2015), 5 Ph.D Scientists on staff and a recently-launched a state-of-the art  Genetics Lab , Steep Hill is the country's leading cannabis analytical lab.  In addition to its core testing business, Steep Hill is also innovative product development Lab that has already developed and commercialized two proprietary products: the QuantaCann and the GenKit. 

The QuantaCann is an on-site potency and moisture machine that provides important analytical information with respect to marijuana samples in 60 seconds.  The QuantaCann was recently featured on CSI Vegas as the scientific equipment used to solve a murder in a marijuana dispensary.  The QuantaCann has been approved as meeting the state requirements for the testing of potency, cannabinoid profiles and moisture by the State of New Mexico.  The scientists at Steep Hill are busy developing the next generation of QuantaCann which will have no moving parts, an upgraded user interface, a wand for testing concentrates and other exciting features.

The GenKit is the first product offering to come out of our Genetics Lab and was introduced to the market as of March 1, 2015.  The GenKit contains 8 test packages which allow growers to clip a tiny portion of a seedling leaf and then send that package to the Lab.  Once received, our geneticists are able to identify which plants are male plants.  That information is then communicated to the customer through a convenient tracking system and the grower is then able to use this information to cull the male plants much sooner than could be done without the assistance of a genetics lab.  This results in the saving of time, energy and resources and increased crop yield.

We are developing a process called Ionic Migration Leaching to recover metals from subterranean deposits using in-situ electrodes to collect, precipitate, and remove metal ions.  This revolutionary process can be powered by solar, wind or natural gas fuel cell produced electricity.  Our technology is benign to the environment causing minimal disturbance as only the desired metals are extracted and removed leaving original rock strata in place and untouched.  In essence this technique reverses the natural processes that formed the deposits in the first place.

A deposit containing in excess of $500 million value of uranium has been identified and is being acquired.  This deposit is within an area identified by a US government agency as containing an estimated 200 million pounds of uranium resources.     These resources were thought to be too low grade to produce in the past.  Ionic Migration Leaching would make them profitable to extract  at current prices.

"US10000025A8","Sonoran Financial Services","With a 7-year foothold in auto title lending, Arizona state vehicle title and registration services, vehicle insurance and pre-owned vehicle financing, Sonoran Financial Services, LLC is poised for success in the flourishing pre-owned vehicle market (www.sonoranopportunity.com).  Expansion into direct vehicle sales & financing will dramatically compliment the company's vehicle financial services and grow its existing customer base in the greater Phoenix valley.

Auto title loan facilities offer their customers the ability to meet their short-term financial needs by borrowing funds using their vehicle as collateral. ""Title Loan"" contracts are generally one to two months in duration but are typically renewed by the borrower several times. Per industry standards, these loans are secured by vehicle titles at an amount approximating 50% of the wholesale value of the vehicle. Generally, these loans carry monthly interest rates between 5% - 15% and require the customer to make monthly or bi-weekly payments. For most of these customers, this type of financing is the only option available to them.

In 2008 the company applied for and was selected as a satellite office for the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT) Motor Vehicle Division. As an authorized third party, Sonoran acts as an agent for the ADOT, allowing customers to license and register their vehicles at a convenient neighborhood location.

"US20000025A9","Game Time Tickets Inc","We are a nationally-focused ticket resale company located in Columbus, OH. We buy and sell tickets to sporting events, concerts and theater events for profit and have been in business for a year and a half. Our company in the past three months (December through February) has done $160,000 in sales for a profit of over $40,000. We broadcast our tickets across a wide number of markets and vendors using the most advanced technology available to get the tickets available in as many places as possible.   We also have been proactively building software to help us better research and find tickets, such as building software that notifies us when venues release tickets to sold out events that we know are already profitable. Thus, having this kind of technology allows us to essentially guarantee a profit on a percentage of our purchases since they're for events that are proven money-makers. One of the biggest reasons we're actively looking for investment is to allow us to build even more software that notifies us of low ticket notifications, sales trends and much more!  Our business is easily scale-able with the technology and infrastructure that we've already built , but we just need more resources to get to a multi-million dollar revenue business on a much quicker timeframe. We were founding in November 2013 with an initial investment of only $2,000, so you can see the growth we've already shown.

It is our objective to provide regional waste companies and communities a viable ""partner"" to implement residential curbside recycling programs and community sponsored recycling programs. We differ from our competitors in that we truly look at our customers as partners and have developed a profit sharing arrangement that allows the customer to realize a profit from the collected material without having to build processing facilities. This business is scalable and we are currently looking as sites in KY and OK for our next Projects. Once operational we will also add similar products for Commercial/Industrial customers where we will work with customers to develop solutions to their current waste management programs which will focus on diverting material from landfills thereby avoiding costs for transportation and landfilling tip fees. The product offering will allow the customer to reduce costs and find value in material previously viewed as waste. We are currently seeking lease/debt financing for the Project in Licking County Ohio. We have a Venture Capital partner that has committed $600K in equity to the Project Company. In addition to the equity commitment of $600,000 we have a commitment from Westfund, LLC to provide a $300K AR line of credit once we are operational.

These digital all-weather signs will have a high-intensity LED integrated warning light system that incorporates an automated vehicle speed display. Most drivers, at one time or another, have found themselves speeding through a restricted speed zone whether a school zone, a pedestrian crossing, or a construction zone. Generally drivers are preoccupied with traffic in their immediate vicinity and not conditions that are off in the distance. This is literally a proverbial ""not seeing the trees for the forest"" scenario. Adding to problem is warning signage are located many feet in the air where they are often not noticed or are not noticed soon enough to reduce speed before entering a school crossing. Further compounding this problem is many school crossings do not have flashing light warning systems. Often times school crossings are in operation during low light conditions - that obviously being in the early morning hours and, in some areas, during dusk hours. There has been approximately 180 school crossing deaths during a ten year period many of which could have been prevented by our innovative illuminated ""smart"" school crossing sign.   	Where are we at? Our provisional patent has been submitted and we have the conceptual drawings in SolidWorks 2015 which is an advanced product engineering software that can drive manufacturing equipment.

TPI is a strategic partner of the investor group focused on mitigating risk for the investor while being mindful of a loan’s feasibility for the borrower. Our process includes incorporating loan to value (LTV) or combined loan to value (CLTV) ratios that meet investors’ lending criteria, utilizing Construction Control inspectors to verify and report on rehab progress, and collateralizing borrower assets when necessary. We also establish relationships with and draw upon the knowledge of our trusted “boots on the ground” (BOTG) teams in each area, which includes project managers, attorneys, licensed brokers, title & escrow companies, and experienced contractors in close proximity to the funding project. Using these methods, Tiger Property Investments Inc. has helped real estate investors exceed their return on investment (ROI) expectations while maintaining the safety of their funds. 

Tiger Property Investments Inc. has grown from $400,000 in assets to more than $5 million in our first year. We have been able to accomplish this largely because of our philosophy to create win, win scenarios. We do this by building mutually beneficial relationships with our fellow investors and our borrowers. We have gained a broad knowledge base through our own active participation in real estate investing.

Minimal competition, strong differentiation, and large untapped market in the U.S. 3. Affordable Healthcare Act: enables millions more people having access to healthcare, the number of physicians is rapidly decreasing, thus there is becoming limited access (longer wait times for apts., shorter apts., difficulty getting prescriptions refilled.  Reasons Physicians join concierge programs: 1. Attractive economics. 2. Keeps the existing practice, both subscribed and unsubscribed patients. 3. Satisfies patient demand for closer ties to their physician (95% annual renewal rate) 3. Provides a degree of financial certainty in light of the decreasing fee for service reimbursements.

The massage services sector is growing rapidly in conjunction with the aging US population and growing consumer awareness of the therapeutic benefits of massage.

After clearing the air many times that my business had NOTHING to do with Peppergood in local and national press and spending lots of money to rebuild the business' reputation, through mutual agreement of my business partners, we felt that in August 2014 that it was time for a merger, which would combined be known as Heartland Internet Media Networks.  Pre-merger, Heartland Internet Media Networks started in August 2011 as a broadcast media consultant group, but would expand into multimedia production/post-production and broadcast syndication, advertising sales, voiceovers and website design. It has evolved into a multimedia powerhouse, producing many radio programs, as well as leading several programs to syndication status. We produce 16 radio programs, develops, constructs and maintains 30 websites and serves as sole syndicator of 6 radio programs.  Post-merger, HIMN is the largest multi-specialty company in south central Illinois. Some improvements we have made include an expansion of our multimedia division which includes livestreaming of a gaming podcast on Twitch.tv (currently on seasonal hiatus) and media syndication to YouTube, a revenue growth of 45% and a 75% increase in work order assignments in our I.T. division and the introduction of our freelance journalism division at the beginning of the year. We're still trying to boost up revenue in our retail division through Amazon and our newly opened store on the Square Marketplace.","EquityNet","Technology","IT Services","Information Technology Services","Nokomis","IL","US","http://www.heartlandmedianetworks.com","http://www.equitynet.com/c/heartland-internet-media-networks","Equity","Active","2015-03-24 18:11:38","2015-03-24 18:11:38","FALSE","60000.0","","","","","","http://www.linkedin.com/company/2528630?trk=tyah","https://www.facebook.com/heartlandinternetmedianetworks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Problem: 		 		 We’re solving a problem that most everyone has faced. It’s not easy for you to know what’s going on in your city on a given night. And then once you do go out, you might get to a bar, only to find it has a huge line, or worse, is totally empty. You therefore waste time, and perhaps even money, going from place to place 	   	 		 			 Solution: 		 		 			 Banter! provides you information about all the events in your city, from happy hours nearby to all the live bands, DJs and comedy shows in your city that night, including if people you know have indicated they’ll be attending. Then, as the night begins, you can see photos and other real-time information being shared by people at restaurants, bars &amp; clubs so you can visually see how busy a place is, the vibe and even the type of people that are there, all in real-time. 		 	     	 Market Opportunity   	 We’re targeting millennials that like to go out. This market is huge. In the 10 US cities we’ve already launched in, alone, there are 6 million people that fall into our target market. Globally, this number is more than 120M. We’re focusing most of our efforts in San Francisco, New York and Boston, have done soft launched in 7 other US cities, and are also doing small pilot programs in Mexico, Panama and India to ensure our product can scale globally.   	 Business Model:   	 We’re building three main revenue streams to monetize our users: 1) A paid set of premium features for users; 2) Sponsored content from local artists, DJs, promoters and beverage brands; 3) Commission from transactions from ticket sales, cover charges and bottle service reservations made through Banter. Our revenue will scale as we grow, and we expect to make &gt; $1M in revenue by the time we get to 500K monthly users   	 Competitive Advantage:   	 There are other nightlife apps out there like YPlan, Fever and Bartrendr, but even at this early stage, we already provide 5 to 10 times more daily events than most of our competitors through our technology and API integrations. We’ve also established partnerships with other companies and local businesses that let us provide more value to our users by giving them access to tickets, bottle service reservations and rewards from local bars &amp; restaurants.

"US1000002650","AxonDx, LLC","Circulating Tumor Cells (“CTCs”) in the bloodstream are a link between primary cancerous tumors and their secondary cancer sites (metastases/recurrences). They are thought to be the earliest sign of solid tumors, and they can be detected in a simple blood sample. CTCs reflect the current state of all cancer sites and offer a thorough prognostic insight into a patient’s cancer. The capture and characterization of CTCs from blood promises to guide the use of highly targeted therapies – i.e., “personalized” medical treatment – and to enable much earlier detection of primary cancer.  
 
Current CTC equipment is slow, expensive, offered as an outsourced service, and is not sufficiently sensitive to provide useful data. Only one CTC instrument is currently FDA approved, and it suffers limited use and a poor reputation because it takes over 4 hours, misses entire classes of CTCs, and does limited cellular characterization. 

AxonDx’s nCYTE™ technology scans un-enriched blood samples in minutes, finds all classes of CTCs shed by solid tumors, and offers morphological and outsourced molecular characterization of positive cells. The nCYTE™ approach is fast, vastly more accurate, compact, easy to adopt, and cost effective enough to be offered at the point of care. Collectively, the nCYTE™ advances represent new era, game-changing improvements over all existing CTC detection technologies.  
 
AxonDx sells nCYTE™ instruments and diagnostic kits designed for the instruments in a “razor and blade” business model. ","EquityNet","Healthcare","Med.

Have you ever met anyone who went to school and acquired a bunch of book knowledge, and then went out into the real world and had difficulty applying what they had learned to everyday life?

This is the problem opusomni is designed to solve. Opusomni translates book knowledge into lived experience, so people perform education, work, and health management tasks better.

Opusomni is a patented system, rooted in a broad body of evidence in the life sciences about what factors drive performance achievement in authentic environments. We bake that evidence into a mobile device form factor that is easy and fun to use whether you are seven or seventy.

The value proposition for our users is to: (1) facilitate the learner-mentor relationship to drive performance achievement in authentic learning environments; (2) generate meaningful, real-time informatics and analytics using machine learning of the data set to “sort the signal from the noise on the internet” to serve up content to help learners achieve their goals; and (3) stimulate sophisticated research through a massive, elegantly designed structured data set, evidence-based theoretical framework, and powerful learning system to examine and improve performance for our learners.

We have proof of concept through a year-long pilot study conducted at Washington University in St. Louis.

Did you know that 75% of all healthcare costs go to manage chronic diseases?

Yes, that’s right! Yet, today we have no way to effectively manage chronic diseases where people live their everyday lives.

A-teko, the healthcare vertical of the opusomni ecosystem, is Telemedicine 2.0, and will effectively manage chronic diseases where people live their everyday lives.  The system is designed to reduce hospital readmission rates, reduce healthcare costs, improve patient satisfaction, and improve patient quality of life.","EquityNet","Technology","Computer Software","Internet Software & Services","St. Louis","MO","US","http://opusomni.com","http://www.equitynet.com/c/translational-education-llc","Equity","Active","2015-04-26 20:37:24","2015-04-26 20:37:24","TRUE","5000000.0","100000.00","","","","","","","https://twitter.com/opusomni","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The loan has already been approved by the bank, and Allstate corporate has given the green light to close and take over the agency June 1st, 2015. The loan is contingent on a $50,000 down payment from the buyer. The President has already made a good faith payment of $5,000 when he signed the purchase agreement. He is now seeking investors for the $45,000. This will leave him with the capital reserves necessary to insure a smooth takeover. As part of the negotiation, the seller agreed to continue paying for the operating expenses of the business until the first Allstate commission payment comes in, about 6 weeks after the takeover. The seller has also agreed to transfer the security deposit on the office lease. There is no security deposit for the utilities. The bank is lending $1,125,000 for 10 years at 7.25% and the seller is holding a note for $300,000 for 10 years at 7.25%. Your initial investment capital will be returned in the first 12 months.

"US1000002673","Organic Merchants Co."," 	Organic Merchants Co. is a vertically integrated direct to consumer food company. We specialize in premium, non perishable, natural and organic products. By cutting out the co-packer, distributor, and retailer, we simply deliver the highest quality products at the best value. After my 15+ years working for others and running Companies in the natural and organic food space, I realized all of the layers of markup in traditional distribution very simply lead to inflated prices on high quality products. Our model harnesses the awareness and appetite developed by our competitors marketing efforts, and then captures their customers directly when that same consumer looks for value. A simple analogy is as follows: A consumer goes to Whole Foods, decides they want to try chia seeds, and they buy them in an 8oz bag at Whole Foods. They pay $9-12 for this bag (or more). That same consumer decides they like chia seeds, but that to have them as an every day item in their cupboard is price prohibitive at $12-$24/lb. This consumer goes online and searches for a better value. We deliver the right size at the right pricepoint, all while maintaining healthy margins since we are the importer, packager, and direct to the consumer retailer. Additionally, we have favorable cash cycles since we are prepaid rather than assuming any credit risk and waiting for 30-60 days for payment. Finally, our bag of tricks in the eCommerce trade - specifically Amazon - allow us to rapidly achieve top 20 status in virtually any category and then sustain those positions ensuring a continuous residual order flow on all items.

Americans' love for dogs continues to grow and dog lovers consider their pets as family and are willing to go to extreme measures to protect and care for their furry best friends. Combine love of pets with the busy work lives that two income households must live, and the massive opportunity becomes clear.   	Otis &amp; Friends was named after the founders English Bull Dog, Otis.  The family has three dogs and found it very difficult to get care for their dogs.  In fact, the Rawitch Family has been paying $125 per day, to have their 3 dogs cared for.  Even with that expense, they found that most Pet Sitters did not show up as promised.  Yes, the dogs were fed, but the Pet Sitter did not walk them or play with them This was discovered through the use of Web Cams used at their front door.   	Otis &amp; Friends is a safe and secure place to leave your dog, whether you want them to stay and play for the day, or overnight, while you travel.  Web Cams will be located in each room of the facility, giving owners the pleasure and security of watching their dog 24/7, should they desire.  This is not uncommon for other upscale Doggy Day Care businesses.  However, we take it another step!  Each Dog will be provided with a Micro Camera that is worn on the dog's collar.  So, not only can you watch your pet play, you can also see the world as your Furry Friend sees it all day long.   	The business is being built with concierge service that includes Red carpet drop off.

"US10000026AF","eSurface","EarthOne Circuit Technologies Corporation “dba eSurface ” was established in August, 2010 to develop and market an evolutionary, patented technology for applied conductive materials on virtually any surface.   eSurface is an advanced materials sector company with multiple industry applications.  Nonetheless, the company is focused on first prosecuting the circuit board (PCB) industry opportunity, before addressing others.

Currently, the PCB industry predominantly employs a ""subtractive"" manufacturing method,  which is highly labor and process intensive, produces poor yields at finer geometries and is limited in shape (flat only) and number of compatible  substrates.  Accordingly, advanced micro-electronics designs are increasingly cost-prohibitive and ""no-bid"" projects are becoming more and more common.   The subtractive method is very caustic to the environment and the waste by product is expensive to mitigate. Furthermore, an antiquated process makes for a heavily commoditized market with extremely low margins.

Enter eSurface, a fully additive process.  Manufacturing is simpler and more efficient, with far fewer processing steps.  Yields are higher, even in multiples, for much finer and far more complex PCB designs.  Labor usage and space requirements are reduced by multiples.  Finally, as a result of these improvements, production costs are projected to  descend by 50% or more.

Additionally, eSurface enables enhanced signal integrity, due to far tighter tolerances, expanded material selections, allowing plating of circuits on practically any material and shape, including 3D surfaces.  
 Also, there is vast improvement in adhesion of metal to substrate and, lastly, important  environmental benefits via a closed loop process, radically reducing toxic waste.  All of these improvements make for significant advances in microelectronics.

The eSurface business model is to license its technology to manufacturers for a royalty fee.

The company’s initial focus is to reduce the amount of coal used in power plants.  By introducing sustainable biomass energy forms(HAFP) to replace a significant portion of coal as well as the petroleum coke currently used, the environmental quality of traditional energy generation is greatly enhanced while maintaining full energy output. In laymen terms, we will keep the BTUs consistent with current output levels at the plant while burning a much cleaner and greener fuel for the environment. 
 
Environmental Enhancement 
In addition, EDE's executives are in negotiations with numerous utilities to reduce the fly ash problems that currently exists at all major power plants around the world. Fly ash is a coal byproduct, which represents a serious environmental threat facing all traditional power plants.  Empire’s plans will help to remove the fly ash from existing power plants, while replacing certain toxic fuels currently in use worldwide.
 
Long-Term Environmental Strategies
While the Company is currently initiating coal-reduction strategies involving increased use of sustainable biomass, its longer-term plans center on zero-emission fuel science.

Vertical Integration
 The Company is immediately implementing a vertical integration strategy by acquiring all of its supply components, including high BTU, low-ash coal and biomass reserves, patent-able environmental-friendly processes, multi-use assets, and the complete means of production and manufacturing.
 
 Immediate Capital and Profitability
To accomplish this vertical integration, EDE has begun a capital raise to purchase the reserves and equipment to fulfill an existing contract, which ensures immediate profitability during the planning phase of its environmental energy projects.

"US10000026CB","American Gas & Technology","American Gas & Technology (AG&T) produces liquid natural gas (LNG) as an alternative fuel for the transportation industry.  It is the only Nano-scale, on-site production of LNG in the world.   

Birthed in Silicon Valley, AG&T believes liquid natural gas (LNG) is the alternative transition fuel of the future.  As long as we continue to use the combustion engine LNG is the simplest hydrocarbon we have and the cleanest fossil fuel in existence.  It's non-toxic, it's safe to breath, it does not affect water quality and it’s safe for sea life.  If spilled it does not leave a residue, it evaporates quickly, when mixed with air it becomes to lean to burn and simply vaporizes.  At current commodity price levels it costs less than 60 cents a gallon.  In North America we have over a 100-year supply of natural gas, enough that it would allow us to become completely independent upon foreign oil. The real question maybe, why aren't we using it now?

Zeus Intelligence reports there are only 29 LNG manufacturing plants in the U.S. today and DOE reports only 81 fueling stations.  The average plant produces over 100,000 gallons per day.  What makes AG&T unique is our ability to manufacture under 2,000 gallons a day.  At this ""Nano-scale"" AG&T liquefiers fall under the higher regulatory burdens of larger plants and by occupying such a small foot print AG&T liquefiers are portable and can easily be placed in a fleet operators parking lot.  After tapping into the local utilities natural gas lines, AG&T can be produced LNG on-site for use as an alternative fuel for cars and trucks.

In the battle to fight global warming and climate change, AG&T liquefiers are also a perfect fit for solving the worlds air pollution problems stemming from  fugitive gases coming from oil & gas  drilling sites as well as public landfills.  AG&T liquefiers are modular in design and can be scaled to fit the varying demands often required in remote landfill and drilling site locations.

The Company aims to purchase pre-owned yachts and upgrade the yachts to today’s highest quality standards, including the latest technology, amenities, accommodations and entertainment. The advantage of this is that yachts have already been built and can be put into the program immediately. The shares will be broken down by weeks, with the first two having thirty four (34) shares available and the other three having forty (40) shares available.   	 INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY The Company is seeking $3 million of debt financing into the Company, to be paid back 6 months after investment at a 15 percent rate of return. Meisler Yachts is expected to breakeven in December of 2015 through generating $26,868,000 in revenue.  A summary of the projections is highlighted in the figure below.     PROJECT UNIQUENESS Meisler Yacht Founder and Owner, Gustav Meisler has been a luxury yacht owner and has operated charter businesses for many years. After spending the last 25 years working and studying the international luxury yacht and cruise industry, he has over the last eight years concentrated on the development of the new trend-the fractional ownership industry. The fractional ownership industry has shown success with private jets, hotel chains, cars, jewelry and a few more.   In 2006, the Company wanted to launch with three identical new luxury motor yachts in the Part Ownership Program.  Unfortunately, the economic crisis in 2008 occurred, and the construction contract came to a halt.

Joe founded his law firm initially to help claimants applying for disability benefits through the Social Security (SSDI/SSI) and the Veterans' Administrations (VA).  He knows firsthand that dealing with the federal government can be frustrating and unnecessarily  confusing.   	Many of the veteran business owners that came to Whitcomb Law, PC, indicated a  desire to start their own business and eventually become verified as Veteran owned in order to improve their chances of winning  government contracts.  Joe and his team have grown that practice area from a few small clients who had done little more than file Articles of Incorporation, to more than 70 commercial clients all over the U.S.  By keeping the practice areas federal, Whitcomb Law has effectively thrown off the geographical limitations that encumber many law firms.  By maintaining a largely transactional and administrative practice, the firm is able to expand its scope, while minimizing infrastructure costs.   	By creating a hybrid business model of long term contingency fee work and short term hourly engagements, the firm accomplishes near full utilization of human resources, while maintaining a work-life balance that drastically reduces turn-over and increases team buy-in.  Diversification served the firm when government shutdowns, sequestration, and budget cuts were killing other less diverse firms.  The firm's focus in advertising in online mediums including well placed PPC campaigns and organic SEO efforts have increased its visibility nationally.

We are offering 40% of the company to our initial investors in this private placement for $3.5 per share, and we are also filing an S-1 to go public within 6 to 8 months. 


We are a Nevada company that plans to establish a company to manage global full risk contracts between  provider organizations and health plans across the nation.  Through the Affordable Care Act the federal government, along with many state governments, is aggressively promoting the passing of health care insurance risk from health plans and MCOs to provider organizations. Evidence of this is the Medicare Shared Savings program, through contracts with Accountable Care Organizations. State governments have undertaken waivered Medicaid redesign programs, with New York being the most aggressive. In New York it is called the DSRIP program. In the waiver approved by CMS, the state has promised that 90% of ALL provider payments in the Medicaid program will be value based. The goal stated in the program documents is to have providers at risk for their services. RIM has formed a relationship with a consulting firm that has a healthcare division, and is actively working to gain access to PPSs, the provider organizations formed under the DSRIP program, to manage their risk contracts. 


RIM has begun reaching out to physician owned IPA who are seeking to enter into full risk contracts with health plans. RIM will supply the management expertise to manage the risk successfully in long term contracts of 20 years or more. RIM will poll the primary care providers in the IPA and determine the health plan that has the most members in the PCP practices. RIM will then approach the plan to acquire a global risk contract. RIM Healthcare Strategies, INC has formed relationships with several Faith Based denomination’s leadership. It has proposed to set up an IPA/ACO in New York City that would be owned by the Faith Based organizations. RIM will contract with a Medicare Advantage Plan (MAPD) on a full risk basis.

"US10000026FB","Zinger Digital Signs","We are opening a Zinger Digital Signs franchise in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. 

The Digital Signage market is big business in the United States, growing from $5.25 billion in 2014 to $8.4 billion by 2020. The growth is expected to come from many industries including; Retail, QSR/Convenience, Corporate, Healthcare, Financial and Education. 

Most businesses do not know how to go about purchasing and implementing digital signage because of lack of exposure in local markets, which is due to the limited competition calling on these businesses. Many end up using multiple vendors to complete a simple solution, which adds more costs and slows down the project. 

Zinger Digital Signs is different. Zinger is the first franchise to offer ""end-to-end"" digital signage solutions to businesses, making it easy to implement, saving time and money. The company has obtained exclusive rights to open a Zinger Digital Signs Franchise facility in Fort Lauderdale (Broward County), Florida. 

The franchise also offer solutions for video conferencing and cloud computing. The solutions are all pre-designed bundles and delivered in about a week, for one-simple price. The franchisees also provides profitable recurring services including; installations and in-field tech services, content creation, training, remote-managed services and software-as-a-service applications, for a complete “one-call” for businesses. 

Broward County is a prime area for a Zinger Digital Signs franchise. There are approximately 54,000 businesses in Broward County. And this area has several industries which are heavy users of digital signage, including Tourism, Gaming/Casinos, Attractions and Transportation.

Post-crisis regulations have drastically reduced the ability of  bond dealers to hold and deploy inventory, draining their capacity to provide liquidity in the credit markets.

"US1000002724","MVP World Wide LLC","“Vaping” is simply inhaling any kind of vapor–usually through an e-cigarette or vape pen. Vaping is best known for helping thousands reduce or break their nicotine habit. People who have traded traditional cigarettes for e-cigarettes report better health, easier breathing, deeper sleep, and better check-ups at the doctor. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to vaping’s potential. Vaping is an incredible delivery system for tapping into the mood-altering powers of virtually all of Mother Nature’s bounty: plants, roots, leaves, fruits, seeds, barks and more. Now you can choose your mood more effectively than ever. Energy. Relaxation. Mental focus. Sexual arousal. Confidence. Happiness. Peace. It’s all available through the magic of the Mood Vapor Pen. It’s important to understand–vaping isn’t smoking. There’s no flame and nothing is burned. Instead, the Mood Vapor Pen creates a fine vapor, like steam. And what isn’t inhaled dissipates immediately, with no after aroma. A Mood Vapor Pen electronically generates just enough heat–without overheating–to release the essential medicinal and psychoactive compounds you choose. Mood Vaping doesn’t alter the precious ingredients being inhaled. It just delivers them immediately to the brain for the maximum effect…with the minimum cost and effort. Vaping is actually healthier than pills or edible concoctions, because it goes straight to the brain and puts no strain on the digestive system. Plus, since vaping produces virtually no smoke, you inhale little or no tar, ash or other toxic elements. There’s no combustion, no burning, no danger. More and more people are appreciating the importance of natural health. Mood Vaping contributes to health by giving you easy access to natural herbs which have been used for healing throughout history, around the world. The MVP ingredients in our herbal blends are all lab-tested, non toxic, organic and 100% natural.

"US300000272C","Beyond The U, LLC"," 	BTU is disrupting a process that hasn't really changed in over 50 years...hiring recent college graduates. BTU is singularly focused on increasing the number of recent college graduates who leave campus with not just a job but a career. At BTU we provide two things that college students desperately need; a scientific and objective way for them to determine what career they would enjoy and succeed at and a personal guide to help them navigate a process that is completely foreign to them and for which they have almost no training or experience…finding their first real job.   	A recent Accenture study found that 61% of college graduates leave campus without a job.  And if that wasn’t bad enough, only half of the employed graduates find jobs that even require a college degree.  The net result is college graduates have on average over $35,000 in student debt and about 80% have no suitable job to show for it.   	The marketplace for college recruiting is simply an unstructured, inefficient mess. Companies are making important hiring decisions on extremely limited and subjective information. The results are predictable. Over 40% of new college hires “wash out” in the first 18 months after beginning their first post college job. Mis-hires cost a company on average $60,000 per college recruiting failure. Many of the remaining placements are ill suited to the job function and company they join due to their desperation to find any job that can help them begin to make a dent in their mountain of debt and limited suitable job options. This lack of early career success is extremely costly both to the college graduate and the companies that hire them.

The Company systematically and accurately extracts data from  research studies and standardizes them in order to provide immediate and accurate evidence-based treatment information.  

This new cloud-based, low cost subscription service will reduce the time a physician or patient now spends searching for information on the latest evidence-based disease treatments and outcomes from weeks and months to a few minutes.  No more cumbersome and inaccurate keyword searches. Instead, information will be reported through targeted database queries, powered by both patient-specific and disease-specific filters.  What physicians and patients get is the exact medical treatment information they are looking for in an easily understood report, at a button click.  

The key value proposition is that physicians will have, for the first time, all available science to confirm (or refute) their standard of care and patient treatment options, thus ensuring better patient outcome and eliminating treatment options that show no efficacy.  Currently, an estimated $700 Billion is spent each year in the U.S. on treatments that show no efficacy, or worse, cause harm. The Company's SDaaS will help physicians make the best treatment decisions, saving significant cost.

I will try to avoid all of the enticing self-promoting egos, visions of grandeur, innuendos, and flowery promises normally laced in proposals.  I retired out of the construction/home improvement industry over 20 years ago. My company had over 5000 employees and subcontractors in five states.  I know how to expand, manage, and grow a business with multiple locations.    Two years ago while living in Maui my wife was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. With a 96% death rate we naturally took her home to Mandeville. This brave woman turned down chemotherapy and radiation making her possibly the rarest survivor in the world. She will tell you that Ion Alkaline Water is a huge part of her recovery.   I have never been more passionate about anything in my life as I am about Ion Alkaline Water.  At 67 I hope to do this quicker than the 25 years it took me to grow the construction business.  I have five new locations that I personally plan to open this calendar year.    Mandeville Louisiana was a real retail challenge for several reasons.  The people are full of life and very friendly but the state is not known for its healthy lifestyle choices ranking third in the nation for obesity. It is rated at number 44 for the lowest income levels, and 45th on education levels. I personally thrive on challenges, yes I spent some money, learned a lot and the store was a huge success its very first year.   	Our Ion Alkaline Water purifiers generate a huge profit revenue stream of 3 to 5 hundred percent; but it was the rental market that I established that bridged the gaps, and every rental unit turned onto a sale within six months.   We are the future of all world water.

In fact, we are still friends with many of them today, even though they live all over the state.  What makes us different, is that we cater to what the campers want in a park.  We have planned activities including themed weekends, hay wagon rides, concerts, bingo, and crafts - just to name a few.  Our bathrooms were always cleaned and well-stocked for our guests.  We stocked our store with items that they may have forgotten or might need; but we didn't over charge them for the items.  I would buy items discounted and charge regular store prices at the camp store.  Our camp store also carried snacks including ice cream, chips, and drinks.  Our new park will offer all of this and more.  

Many campgrounds have an early check out time of 11:00 AM or 1:00 PM so the day you leave you basically have breakfast and pack up to go.  We feel that campers waste a day that they could be enjoying the park and nature.  Therefore, we have decided to have a 4:00 PM check out at our new park.  This way the campers can enjoy a good part of their day before heading home.  This policy alone will attract customers because no other park in Michigan is doing this without charging a late checkout fee.  Also, when you pay to camp, you have access to the entire park and its amenities, with the exception of boat rentals.  One price for camping fun.","EquityNet","Services","Real Estate Services","Real Estate, Other","Harrison Township","MI","US","http://www.equitynet.com/c/l-j-campground-connection","http://www.equitynet.com/c/l-j-campground-connection","Equity","Active","2015-07-04 18:43:53","2015-07-04 18:43:53","TRUE","150000.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"US1000002761","RoadVision Technologies, Inc.","RoadVision is prepared to market launch the Highway Beacon® snowplowable reflective pavement marker.  The product addresses the longest unsolved safety hazard on the nation’s and world’s roadways; wet night pavement visibility in regions that receive snow. 

Painted lane lines become invisible to motorists during night rain. Only reflective raised pavement markers (RPMs) can be adequately seen to provide visual guidance in such conditions. However, anything raised is destroyed by snowplows.  The Highway Beacon’s® raised reflector depresses on impact from vehicle tires or snowplows into the pavement then springs back into position.  

This revolutionary patented design results in the only fully functional all-climate reflective lane delineation system in the world.  The combination of wet/night visibility, durability, snowplow compatibility and ease of maintenance has never before been achieved by any RPM.    

The product is manufactured through a network of top tier U.S. suppliers .  Gross and net profit margins will be exceptional.  Future products will include internally illuminated units for fog and other high hazard locations and airports.

The market for the Highway Beacon® is vast.  The product will be marketed worldwide and is patented in Canada and patent pending in the U.S.  The U.S. total market is over $9 Billion.

Significant market traction has been achieved.  The marker has been approved for installation by multiple agencies. 

The company will  market the product directly to highway agencies in the U.S. and internationally.  However, the primary means of sales will be through well established regional distributors and independent agents/firms who sell highway safety products.

There is no viable competition  in snow climates.  Previous products all have major performance, durability and maintenance deficiencies. Millions were installed in order to address this prevalent   hazard, but are now  largely discontinued due to the deficiencies.","EquityNet","Commerce & Industry","Industrial Equipment","Industrial Equipment & Components","San Marino","CA","US","http://www.highwaybeacon.com","http://www.equitynet.com/c/roadvision-technologies-inc","Equity","Active","2015-07-11 14:34:07","2015-07-11 14:34:07","FALSE","1000000.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Near Infrared Imaging (NII) incorporated in 2009 as an LLC, merged into a Delaware INC, is a “Corporation In Good Standing” with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and has filed and paid all of its Federal and State taxes every year. 

Near Infrared Imaging is owned in part by:

•	The Regents of the University of California (UCLA)
•	The City University of New York (CUNY)
•	Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL)

Our #1 competitor spent $23M to get to this same point that we are now. We accomplished this with $800,000. There are no VC or Angel investors. All of our investors are Mom and Pop investors who believe in the technology and the NII team. We only have 3M shares Authorized and 2M shares Outstanding. We will limit dilution and plan on an early exit strategy. 

Near Infrared Imaging’s first product is the Vein-Eye™, a vein illumination camera that is priced significantly less than the leading selling devices. The Vein-Eye is already selling in more than 35 countries and generating profits and cash flow. We have over 45 distributors and are adding a distributor a week. This is all done with virtually no marketing, advertising, and a very limited sales force. 

Investment funds will go directly to increasing sales and releasing new products already in development. ","EquityNet","Healthcare","Med.

Possible lead indications for which there are proof of concept data: Multiple Sclerosis, Alzheimer’s and/or Parkinson’s Disease, Central Nervous System Injuries, and Seizure Disorders. There is very limited industry progress for the above indications.

No combined anti-inflammatory or aggregate disposal therapies are presently available for neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, or Huntington’s diseases.   CHECs are unique because they target all the principal cellular pathologies in degenerative diseases (inflammation, cell death, protein aggregation) in an orally available formulation.   	Company advisors are Timothy Cunningham, Ph.D., who discovered and isolated the compounds, and Jeffrey Greenstein, M.D., who is a neurologist/immunologist that will supervise clinical applications.

“It's been weeks and I still think about that play every day. I can’t get it out of my head” -- Board Member, Playwrights Horizons (NYC)

“This play is very much about something” -- Backstage West

~    An award-quality script previously audience-tested in three live stage productions in tough markets - NYC and Los Angeles

~    Controversial topic -- workplace sexual assault -- of interest to women's interest groups, a driving force in intelligent film marketing.

Low recovery thresholds and quality scripts offer excellent return opportunities in an expanding film market. The total Production Budget for MsTRIAL is $624,000 (SAG_AFTRA Modified Low-Budget Agreement) offset by ~$125K in pre-sold incentive tax credits and a 50% matching fund commitment ($250K), requiring only an additional $250K to complete financing. The remaining funding of $250K represents a 30% interest in lifetime profits from the film, in addition to the priority return paid to all investors of 115%.

MTP will produce MsTRIAL for 85% less than a comparable studio budget through:

"US10000027AD","Progressive Wireless","Overview 
When AT&T acquired Cricket Wireless in 2014 it virtually doubled Cricket's coverage area. This network expansion has created virgin territories where there is little competition for prepaid wireless services. Progressive Wireless was formed to open 100 Cricket Wireless stores as quickly as possible. Cricket's dealer program provides excellent activation commissions, lifetime residuals and great margins on accessories.

Franchise Like Risk Reduction
There is a reason that 90-95% of franchises succeed. They are based on a long track record of success. There are currently over 3,300 Cricket stores in the U.S. and the parent company was started 15 years ago. As a Cricket dealer, we benefit from many franchise characteristics such as training programs, strong brand and corporate marketing assistance, increased purchasing power, operational support, location and construction assistance etc. Best of all Cricket does not charge a franchise fee.

Management Team
The Company's President was recruited by Cricket Wireless after recently selling his exceptionally run 34-store Sprint dealership. He has an MBA and over 16 years of experience in the wireless industry. Between the officers and board members, the team has over 40 years combined experience in the wireless industry and over a century of business management experience.

Market
The prepaid wireless market segment is large and growing. In the first quarter of 2013 new wireless customers chose prepaid plans 10 to 1 over contract plans. As of 2012 there were 100 million prepaid subscriptions in the U.S. Smartphone sales on prepaid networks doubled from 2012 to 2013 with nearly one third of all smart phones currently on prepaid plans.

Conclusion & Projected Returns
Projections show a 47% average annual cash return over 5 yrs with nearly a 500% ROI assuming a sale or IPO in the fifth year.

"US10000027D2","CPAP TotalCare","Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) therapy is the treatment of choice for Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) and forms the center of our business model.

CTC's  founder, Doug Hudiburg, began building the conceptual foundation of CTC in January of 2008 while working as a full-time consultant in the industry. After leading the team that launched the IntelliPAP family of CPAP machines, and serving as global product manager, Doug developed and managed a trial business unit which was a first-of-its-kind automated telephone patient follow-up system called DeVilbiss Keystone Services which eventually became CareTouch360, now the leading patient ‘call center’ company in the CPAP supply market. 

In December of 2012, Doug and co-founder D.T. Burns, began working on the CTC project and developing prototype software.  We have built a seasoned software team that has developed and beta-launched two separate CPAP therapy management web applications: CPAP TotalCare and SmartLinkWeb.com  both of which provide unique solutions, improvements, and efficiencies that were previously unavailable to the market.  

We have a working product with active users, and experienced management and development teams.

More than 40 million Americans suffer from sleep apnea while only 25% (about 10 million) have been diagnosed. The $2 billion US market is growing at a rate of approximately 8% annually  fueled by increasing obesity rates, the aging baby boomer population, increased awareness, and diagnosis. It’s a large, growing, and mostly “unconverted” market. 

We believe that our opportunity lies in making current best practices more scalable and profitable through the use of efficient interactive patient follow-up and management technology combined with a comprehensive therapy program. By replacing routine human-powered activities with convenient interactive technology, our platform increases patient satisfaction and adherence to therapy while also increasing revenue and reducing overhead.","EquityNet","Healthcare","Healthcare Management","Specialized Health Services","Broomfield","CO","US","http://CPAPtotalCare.com","http://www.equitynet.com/c/cpap-totalcare","Equity","Active","2015-08-25 21:27:50","2015-08-25 21:27:50","FALSE","750000.0","","","","","","https://www.linkedin.com/company/cpap-totalcare","https://www.facebook.com/CPAPTotalCare","https://twitter.com/CPAPtotalCare","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"US20000027D5","Garage Guys","Garage Guys is the world’s first crowdfunded theme park, created with an overarching purpose to create employment opportunities for mentally and physically challenged individuals.  Garage Guys is a family oriented environment with various attractions, located in North Texas.  This is one of the fastest growing economic areas in America, a location which provides Garage Guys with a number of business and occupational growth advantages and developmental opportunities.  
Our strategy is to combine a theme park atmosphere into an automotive industry group in order to develop unique revenue streams that are not ordinarily harnessed in a standalone approach. In all, there will be nine automotive enterprises centered at the foundation of the group (Ford dealership, restoration center, body shop, fabrication shop, machine shop, service center, salvage yard, parts store, and commercial shop) along with 11 entrainment attractions that will focus on family entertainment and recreation (including a hotel, water park, amphitheater, NHRA drag strip, Motocross track, Formula 1 track, Stock-car track, arcade, restaurants, conference building, and art gallery).
Garage Guys business approach provides us the ability to leverage discounts throughout the retail and commercial automotive services and parts industry in a way that no other business can match.  The combination of our entertainment attractions, our mission, and the method in which we link our automotive ecosystem under one umbrella provides the capability of offering services and parts for 20 percent less than our competition, thereby providing a greater profit margin.

"US10000027E9","Snapwire"," 	 Snapwire leverages its community of 155,000 photographers in over 180 countries to deliver authentic, original photos to people who need images. Brands and businesses also pay our photographers to generate inspiration &amp; illustrate concepts.   	 The Problem:   	 The stock photo industry uses mass archives of irrelevant, outdated, pre-shot photos. Searching for the right photo is inefficient and sometimes impossible.   	 The Solution:   	 Customers ask photographers to shoot exactly what they are looking for. Customers create a photo request, describe what they want, set a price, and a deadline. Customers get royalty-free photos that are authentic and up to date delivered to them.   	 How it works:   	 Photographers receive a request and compete by submitting their best shots. Buyers nominate their favorite photos, and build working relationships with their favorite photographers. Photographers earn points and keep 70% when their photos sell. The extra photos that aren’t purchased are curated into our Marketplace, where photographers earn revenue 50% when their photos sell. We don't share beautiful photography, we sell it.   	 Our website and mobile app is a tool for photographers to participate. We enable photographers to go from beginner to the pro level as they reach certain goals. Eventually they participate in pre-paid commissioned photo assignments from recognizable brands and clients.   	 Why us?   	 We are a need-based request platform attempting to disrupt a 70-year old industry. This new purchasing behavior has been recognized by large incumbents. For example, we’re very happy to announce our partnership with Getty Images.   	 Our product has been built to scale. Our DAU over MAU metrics suggests an active user base. Consistently featured on the Itunes App Store (Photo &amp; Video &gt; Discovery &amp; Share) with 5 star ratings. Building a successful company in the stock/commercial photography space relies on a shift to mobile &amp; social.   	 Our metrics prove this shift.   	 The biggest players in the stock photo space work with us; signed partnership deals with Getty, Adobe, Corbis, and more. Since launch in July 2014, we changed the game for thousands of image buyers worldwide.

"US10000027F0","Golden Pacific Capital, LLC"," 	Golden Pacific Capital, LLC is offering equity positions in a fund focused on Kansas City (“KC”) single family residential real estate. The fund is projected to return 16-20% IRR to LPs over a 6-8 year projected hold period – i.e. $270K on a $100K investment. It capitalizes on the principals’ experience having purchased and managed 2000+ homes across a number of other US cities on behalf of institutional buyers. It is a unique opportunity to participate in a limited partnership run in an institutional manner and with institutional-level returns but without the higher minimum investment thresholds usually associated with such a structure. The fund is already operating and has attracted significant equity investment. KC, unlike many other markets in the US, has been relatively stable through the past few years of macroeconomic turmoil and has only in the past 18-24 months begun to show signs of recovery. This is underpinned by a stable local economy with a highly diversified employer base. There is still very significant foreclosure activity and inventory available, and the larger players are not active in this market – a combination which gives us an opportunity to purchase at significant discount to current market value and achieve strong rental yields. Finally, the fund capitalizes on highly affordable debt available in the capital markets, as well as debt providers who have become more sophisticated and more competitively priced in recent years, a trend which we expect to continue.

When AT&amp;T purchased Cricket in 2014 it created new Virgin Territories for Prepaid Wireless services for the first time in a decade. Projected 47% Avg. Cash Return and 500% ROI in five years.   	 	Overview  	When AT&amp;T acquired Cricket Wireless in 2014 it virtually doubled Cricket's coverage area. This network expansion has created a gold rush to open new virgin territories without any Cricket locations in markets where there is little to no competition for prepaid wireless services. Progressive Wireless, LLC was formed to open 100 Cricket Wireless stores as quickly as possible. Cricket's dealer program provides excellent activation commissions, lifetime residuals and great margins on accessories. 	 	Management Team 	The Company's President was recruited by Cricket Wireless after recently selling his exceptionally run 35-store Sprint dealership. He has an MBA and over 16 years of experience in the wireless industry. Between the officers and board members, the team has over 40 years combined experience in the wireless industry and over a century of business management experience. 	 	Market 	The prepaid wireless market segment is large and growing. In the first quarter of 2013 new wireless customers chose prepaid plans 10 to 1 over contract plans. As of 2012 there were 100 million prepaid subscriptions in the U.S. Smartphone sales on prepaid networks doubled from 2012 to 2013 with nearly one third of all smart phones currently on prepaid plans. 	 	Competitive Advantages 	Advantages include management team expertise, proven marketing strategies, virgin territories, strategic locations, ideal combination of Cricket’s available products and excellent services at low prices. We will also utilize advanced business management systems including Retail IQ and RQ4.

"US1000002809","New Detroit LLC","In 2010, Detroit native Dan Gilbert moved his Quicken Loans headquarters to Detroit, purchased nearly $10 billion of prime real-estate, and has dedicated most of his time to his vision for the “new” Detroit.  And since he started putting his vision into action, scores of companies (with an estimated 10,000 workers) have followed his lead and moved their offices to Detroit.
Dozens of companies, many of them in creative industries such as advertising, architecture and design, are flocking to central-city Detroit in a surprising reversal of the mass exodus to the suburbs that took place during the past half century.  (for more detail see http://www.businessinsider.com/after-filing-bankruptcy-detroit-is-on-the-verge-of-an-epic-comeback-2013-7?op=1) 
Detroit is rebounding from its “depression” of a decade ago.  However, real estate values in many areas of the city have yet to respond.  There are a substantial number of homes, owned by banks, whose values have yet to respond to the improving economy in Detroit.  (In 2010 the average price of a home was $7,500.)
New Detroit will acquire homes located in neighbourhoods which are experiencing a “rebirth”.  The homes must have been rehabilitated within the last 3 months and leased to Section 8 tenants or other acceptable tenants.  The purchase price for the homes must be such that the net cash flow, after property taxes, management fees, insurance and a repair allowance, will yield cash returns of at least 10% per annum.  
The supply of vacant homes available at discount prices is substantial.  In 2015 Wayne County estimates that 30,000 homes will be sold for delinquent taxes.  There are a number of companies which purchase foreclosed homes or homes sold for delinquent taxes.  These companies rehabilitate the homes, secure acceptable tenants and sell the leased homes.

These cancel/no-shows represent revenue that can never be recovered, since the time period goes unfilled. Doc-Quick helps Doctors fill those same day cancels/no-shows by providing a ready list of leads, generated in real time, where patients are asking for a same day appointment for a specific medical specialty through our Doc-Quick website.   	While the original failed appointment was probably for an existing patient, the Doc-Quick patient is, most likely, a new patient for the practice, which carries a much higher revenue opportunity for the practice. Doc-Quick brings Patients and Doctors together über fast!   	 	   	Validating the benefit to doctors/imaging centers is easy and quick. There is documented data that shows that the dollar costs to this group is as high as $40 Billion a year nationwide. On average, doctors see a no show/cancel rate of between 15% and 25%.   	Validating the benefit to the patients means defining which patients find a high benefit in same day appointments rather than waiting for weeks for the next available appointment on the calendar. What we found is that millennials do not use the health care system the way that are senior population does. What we see through research and some small survey sampling is that millennials put a high value on time and less of a value on doctor research or peer recommendations. They are our prime audience, although, in talking with baby boomers, while they put a higher value on peer recommendations, their preference on imaging and tests are time.

The term “reviresco” is a Latin word meaning “to grow green again, to be renewed”, a particularly appropriate representation of our core business.   	MSW disposal in the United States is an $8.3 billion industry. Most waste goes to landfill (53%), for which waste generators, mainly municipalities, pay tipping fees, which now average almost $50/ton across the nation and have been rising at rates of nearly 3.5% annually for the last 12 years. More than 30 states are experiencing rates higher than $50/ton including ten states that contain 40% of the US population now have tipping fees at or exceeding $75/ton. Six states have fees in excess of $100/ton. Reviresco will earn tipping fees for waste disposal in lieu of landfill operators.   	Reviresco emerged from more than 5 years of research into waste disposal alternatives and more than $5 million in R&amp;D investment, which together led to the construction of a pilot (proof of concept) plant in the United Kingdom that established a cost-effective and energy-positive system for separating and converting the organic component of municipal and other wastes into usable products.   	A single Reviresco system can of process 30,000 - 50,000 tons of unsorted, unprocessed municipal waste (from households and some institutional and commercial operations) annually, diverting more than 85% of the waste from landfill disposal.   	Reviresco presents an efficient, unique and cost-effective solution to the complex and growing problems of waste disposal for cities, towns and counties in North America and worldwide.   	Each Reviresco plant will earn investment-grade returns with guaranteed revenues from governments and major utilities.

Instead of pets flying in the cargo hold where it is dangerous, the airline flew its pets, in safety, in the main cabin. 

No other airline provided this service then, no other airline provides it now. 
 
Although it was launched during the Global Recession of 2009, over $3.5M was raised. At its demise, it had achieved a Positive Gross Margin and was only about 6 months from breakeven. Strong demand for this service continues to exist.

Nanoprotech has been demonstrated to allow electric drills to operate fully while underwater and to outperform all other anticor products after mere hours of exposure to salt spray. Nanoprotech products have proven to be successful in Europe, Asia, and Africa, and Nanoprotech FL is bringing modern corrosion protection to the Americas.

Nanoprotech is looking for investors/distributors/marketing experts who would like to get a part of the firms equity for their money, extensive distribution or brand recognition input, i.e. we are not only looking for a cash investment, but other forms are also considered.","EquityNet","Services","Retail","Home Products","Fort Lauderdale","FL","US","http://www.nanoprotech.org","http://www.equitynet.com/c/nanoprotech-fl-llc","Equity","Active","2015-10-08 18:37:57","2015-10-08 18:37:57","FALSE","3000000.0","","","","","","","https://www.facebook.com/pages/NanoprotechUSA/407089869440632?fref=ts","https://twitter.com/NanoProtechUSA","https://plus.google.com/116748163791183162908","https://www.youtube.com/NANOPROTECHUSA","http://nanoprotechusa.tumblr.com/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"US3000002842","HOSPITAL OUTPATIENT MODULE","When the prototype is completed and ready for demonstration, the HOM and the homecare concept will be transferred to its affiliate company, Global HOM Care Systems, Inc. to initiate a test marketing campaign to introduce the business venture to the general public.  All initial donations to the organization will be tax exempt.   When the ownership and control of the product and patent-pending concept is transferred to Global HOM Care Systems, the amount contributed to the organization will be automatically converted to shares in the company at $1.00 per share. 

The company is a startup (early stage), and is developed around an inventive medical apparatus called the Hospital Outpatient Module (H.O.M.).   The H.O.M. is a portable/mobile hospital bedroom, fully equipped with the components of a medical treatment room, a nurse’s station and an adjustable, computerized hospital bed.  It is to be delivered to a home, apartment, clinic, doctor’s office, public institution, etc.; and then linked to a Central Monitoring Center via the Internet for round-the-clock patient monitoring, at any location on the globe.  A working prototype will be completed within six months from full subscription.   Go to: http://www.hauserpro.com/hom   for a visual presentation.

Business Model Overview

	The H.O.M. concept is much like the idea of a paper clip:  it is so simple and obvious that “someone must have done it before.”   Fact is, no one has.  The H.O.M. equipment and the accompanying homecare and monitoring systems will be a satisfying alternative to placing a loved-one in a nursing home.  It will minimize the need for lengthy stays in a hospital; it will provide a readily available and portable “MASH” unit for the military; it will reduce the national health care expenditure by as much as one-third; and it will be reimbursable through Medicare and Medicaid and other third-party ","EquityNet","Healthcare","Patient Care","Home Healthcare","Madison","TN","US","http://www.hauserpro.com/hom","http://www.equitynet.com/c/hospital-outpatient-module","Convertible Debt","Active","2015-10-09 17:59:25","2015-10-09 17:59:25","FALSE","2500000.0","395000.00","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Please note that the ARV of 45% for this project is based upon the lot line adjustment, approved entitlements, and the sale of the two parcels separately as planned. If the developer is not able to proceed with a lot line adjustment, the backup plan is to proceed with development of the home and market the property as a residence with a larger combined lot at a higher price.

The software targets the problem of unreliable and unpredictable access to collaboration and presentation devices, as well as the security risks inherent with internet dependent systems. Existing competitors in the market require internet connections and intermediary servers, pushing sensitive materials and collaboration through the web.  Given the sensitive nature of collaboration and presented materials in enterprise applications, (system breach, user compromise etc.), this company’s technology is superior, in that it provides a secure, direct system to share from one device with up to 40 others.

"US1000002857","Equon Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Equon is primed to move its antibodies into pre-clinical trials in preparation for FDA approval treating both Rheumatoid Arthritis and Late Phase Asthmatic Response.  Due to the nature of many other autoimmune conditions, it is highly likely that Equon's antibodies will be able to treat other conditions, expanding the market opportunities.

The estimated market size for those that suffer from Late Phase Asthmatic Response is 2.3 million people and there is currently no competition in the marketplace for a preventative solution such as the one Equon is proposing.  Today individuals who suffer from this type of response need to seek immediate medical attention to restore the ability to breathe.  When the antibodies are taken by the patient on a monthly basis, it will prevent the late phase asthmatic response from happening within the body.   The target is to have FDA approval by 2019 and achieve a 25% penetration rate by 2021 with an annual sales target of $673 M.

Rheumatoid Arthritis impacts an estimate of 1.5 million people.  There is substantial competition in the space including drugs such as Humira.  However, most of the drugs offered to treat patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis have significant side effects including but not limited to the development of cancer and in severe cases death.  Equon’s antibodies will be able to provide a much safer solution with the expectation of minimal side effects.  Equon forecasts FDA approval by year end 2020 and will achieve a 25% penetration rate into the market by 2023 with an annual sales estimate of $661 M.   

The antibody development will be following a specific series of development of which would be incredibly challenging for competitors to replicate.  Some of the keys areas are the human fusion partners, a series of proteins along with the time necessary to gain FDA approval.  It is for these reasons Equon will not be submitting a patent and will be keeping this process a trade secret.","EquityNet","Healthcare","Research & Development","Biotechnology","Henderson","NV","US","http://www.equon.com","http://www.equitynet.com/c/equon-pharmaceuticals-inc","Equity","Active","2015-10-16 18:42:27","2015-10-16 18:42:27","FALSE","5000000.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"US1000002864","MVP WorldWide LLC"," 	Choose your ""Mood"" wisely and feel good without feeling bad! Mood Vapor Pen is a healthy alternative to drugs and alcohol. Vaping herbal extracts with MVP merges Big Pharma and Big-Tobacco, creating an incredible opportunity for profit!    	 	“Vaping” is simply inhaling any kind of vapor–usually through an e-cigarette or vape pen. Vaping is best known for helping thousands reduce or break their nicotine habit. People who have traded traditional cigarettes for e-cigarettes report better health, easier breathing, deeper sleep, and better check-ups at the doctor. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to vaping’s potential. Vaping is an incredible delivery system for tapping into the mood-altering powers of virtually all of Mother Nature’s bounty: plants, roots, leaves, fruits, seeds, barks and more. Now you can choose your mood more effectively than ever. Energy. Relaxation. Mental focus. Sexual arousal. Confidence. Happiness. Peace. It’s all available through the magic of the Mood Vapor Pen. It’s important to understand–vaping isn’t smoking. There’s no flame and nothing is burned. Instead, the Mood Vapor Pen creates a fine vapor, like steam. And what isn’t inhaled dissipates immediately, with no after aroma. A Mood Vapor Pen electronically generates just enough heat–without overheating–to release the essential medicinal and psychoactive compounds you choose.   	Mood Vaping doesn’t alter the precious ingredients being inhaled. It just delivers them immediately to the brain for the maximum effect…with the minimum cost and effort. Vaping is actually healthier than pills or edible concoctions, because it goes straight to the brain and puts no strain on the digestive system. Plus, since vaping produces virtually no smoke, you inhale little or no tar, ash or other toxic elements. There’s no combustion, no burning, no danger. More and more people are appreciating the importance of natural health. Mood Vaping contributes to health by giving you easy access to natural herbs which have been used for healing throughout history, around the world. The MVP ingredients in our herbal blends are all lab-tested, non toxic, organic and 100% natural.   	Mood Pen:   	We sell electronic vapor pens with liquid filled cartridges that contain various herbal extracts, blended together to create a mood effect; Relaxation, Energy, Appetite suppressant, House Blend, Aphrodisiac, CBD, etc. Our cost per ""Mood Pen"" is between $4 to $5, and we sell them for $25, plus s+h. We have 4 herbal formulas for sale now and several more being formulated and tested in an FDA compliant Lab. All herbs used in MVP formulas are 100% for human consumption. The ingredients used in our liquid formulas include, but are not limited to: lavender oil, maca root, magnolia bark, taurine, vitamin c, caffeine, kava kava, valerian extract, and more.   	Instead of using a vapor pen for nicotine which makes it an ""e-cig"", or with marijuana which makes it an ""e-joint"", we use it for natural herbs and call it a ""Mood Pen"". We sell product online and by phone 24/7 via; 60 second TV spot media, wholesale distribution, online affiliate marketing, licensing, vending, etc.   	Remember the first time you saw an electronic cigarette? It may have seemed like a joke. As time passed, maybe a fad. Now, a fact of life. That’s why the third largest tobacco company in the world, Lorillard, paid $135 million for Blu Ecigs. Lorillard has also acquired SKYCIG, a premium brand of e-cigarettes in the UK. And Green Smoke was bought by Philip Morris for $120 million. Altria Group, the makers of Marlboro, is releasing an electronic cigarette. British American Tobacco has launched its version of a vape cigarette. And Phillip Morris has already proclaimed vaping “the single greatest opportunity for us.” Savvy investors outside the tobacco industry see the financial potential in vaping as well.  	Bottom Line: To the uninformed, Mood-Vaping may now seem just an interesting niche. But with its skyrocketing growth–especially among young people–it may well become the world’s favorite delivery system for mood change. We’re banking on it. Don’t ignore this lucrative opportunity.

The game play is based on a salary cap format where each fantasy athlete is given a salary, i.e Aaron Rodgers - ""$10,800,""  based on their real-life past performance. A user would pick a lineup, which varies depending on the sport, and would have to stay under a $100,000 salary cap.

Not only does this offer a new fun way to play, but it also allows for correction if the user picks a player that doesn't do well or gets injured during gameplay. The first ""Benchwarmer"" is free and the second is 10% of that tournaments entry free, i.e. $2 entry = $0.20 Benchwarmer upgrade cost that is 100% profit to the company and is not distributed back to the user or contest.

The Market: Years of research on a club concept and pricing has been performed. We have successfully attracted members during our pricing research at gun shows and online. We have identified that while guns and ammo are shopped for the best pricing, accessories are not. This is a huge area on which to concentrate and to leverage.

Our Goal: The sports weapons industry is currently one of the most fragmented industries in the U.S. Individuals are unable to find the best prices. Arm & Protect aims to consolidate an otherwise fragmented industry by providing a retail and web presence as a wholesale buying club for best pricing.

Our Members: Will value the opportunity to earn discounts for bringing others into the club and sharing the experience of buying at a great price.

Spinning Promotions is a 3 sided spinning display that is either mounted on the top of a taxi/automobile, on the back of a truck, or on top of an endcap in a retail store. Spinning Promotions is successful because the unit is constantly moving and it catches the attention of just about everyone in viewing distance.   	No one can resist looking at these unique Spinning Promotions units.   	Today Spinning Promotions Billboard truck is a new and the most creative outdoor advertising medium on the streets. We tell clients it is like having a refrigerator on the back of a truck that spins. What is funny is that the unit is larger than a refrigerator and is stunning! There is not a single person that does not look and point at the truck. Each face is seen twice every minute and in 1 week each face is seen over 10,000 times. At night the truck has 600 watts of light power that makes it GLOW at night. Each face is 6' high by 4.5' wide and each truck has 3 faces. We rent each face on a weekly bases and each truck brings in about $8000 profit per month - after all expenses.   	The competition is Taxi Tops - Each top is between $150 and $280 per 4 weeks and no campaign is less than 50 taxi's. In NY the minimum is 200 taxi's per campaign. So a campaign in Boston costs is $8000 plus the cost of the graphics. In NY the campaign costs over $50,000 for 4 weeks. The success of a taxi top is questionable!   	A billboard on the Mass pike in Boston cost $13,000 per month, and in a small town the cost is about $4000 plus the cost of the billboard.   	The cost for a complete truck, all 3 sides on Spinning Promotions for a month is $12,000 before discounts, and the return on investment on the spinning promotions truck is HUGE. The truck goes all over town and EVERYONE SEES IT! The Spinning Promotions truck has a 360 degree viewing radius, so unlike a taxi, you can see this message day and night and from all angles!   	This truck is amazing and has no competition and the ROI is HUGE! We have great demand and have to build 1 truck per week but this will take $250,000 to get to our goal.   	We are looking for a few good investors that want to jump on board this Patented advertising solution and will receive 10% for their investment per year.

Approximately 90% of tourists travel to New York to shop and 84% to sightsee. The quarter mile commercialized waterfront section of the city will offer visitors activities in a scale that is unique to the city. Tourists currently pay $40 to take a 1.5-hour bus ride to Woodbury Commons for an outlet shopping experience and yet the outlet attracts over 13m visitors a year. Empire Outlets will only be a 22-minute free ferry ride from downtown Manhattan. Along with sightseeing and shopping activities, The New York Wheel location will offer various levels of dining opportunities from cafe to fine dining. Once the project is completed, St. George could be one of the top reasons people visit NYC: sightseeing, shopping, fine dining, sports, theater and culture.

"US1000002883","Consolidated Secure Notes II LLC","Investors will receive a preferred disbursement of profits.

The institutional banks, lenders and REO owners have already written non-performing assets down. The banks and other institutions (holders of these assets) are not prepared to handle a quick and orderly disposition of the non-performing assets.  In addition, the Federal Regulatory agencies are requiring the banks and other institutions to liquidate non-performing assets to comply with regulations including the Dodd-Frank law.

With Banks paying historic low interest rates on savings accounts and the volatility of the stock market, many investors are obtaining very low yields on their money. Investors are looking for options to increase monetary performance through other investment vehicles.

CSN has the resources to source and acquire the notes and REOs from the institutions.

CSN will purchase and quickly reposition these non-performing notes and assets. Some of these acquired notes will be modified to become re-performing and sold to cash flow investors. Other notes will be converted to REOs by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure and foreclosures and they will be sold as quickly as possible.  The company plans to convert the notes and REOs to cash and then re-invest the original partnership equity and distribute the profits quarterly.

CSN’s profits will be derived from the spread between the deeply discounted purchases and the subsequent sale of the notes and REOs.

Management is not salaried and will look to profit participation for its compensation.

$3,000,000 Capital raise to purchase non-performing 1st position notes in real estate and institutional real estate owned (REO).

The membership interests are $10,000 each or multiples thereof. Membership interests are available only to accredited investors.

"US1000002885","Guardian BirthCare","What is the BirthBuddy® device that has been invented by Guardian BirthCare? 

The BirthBuddy is a patented, non-invasive birthing device ergonomically designed to help birthing mothers push their baby easily and safely down the birth canal during the ""pushing"" stage of labor. It is manufactured here in the USA from a soft plastic material at a precisely defined density that gives it the exact flexibility needed to be most effective in helping the mother. 

 The objective in using the BirthBuddy is to greatly reduce the mother's pushing time during the second (""pushing"") stage of labor.  This is accomplished by causing specific muscles to be utilized, thereby increasing the force exerted during a contraction, which results in bringing the baby down the birth canal easier and faster. In a normal childbirth, this can often result in a safer birth by avoiding a cesarean section, vacuum extraction or the use of forceps. And, of course, less time in labor results in less stress on both the baby and the mother. 

For additional information on the company and its uniquely designed product, please see the Business Plan Overview and our Website at www.birthbuddy.com.
