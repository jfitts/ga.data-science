As such, I have informally provided insight on the pros/cons on various donation-based crowdfunding portals/platforms as well as some of the factors which imact crowdfunding success in this area.  I have also created and delivered toolkits for use in pre-raise and active-raise efforts; also in donation-based crowdfunding.

Third, many records did not include a city or had partial address so these were removed.  Next, many records did not include a Women-Led PIPR indentifer so Unknown was used in these instances.
